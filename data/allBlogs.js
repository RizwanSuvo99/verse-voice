    title: 'A life full of promises cut short',
    description: `Man, I still can't believe it. Mugdho, just a guy like us, full of dreams and future plans, is not here anymore. It’s just so unfair. He was trying to help people, and then this happens—he loses his life in such a horrible way.

I saw this video of him, like 15 minutes before everything went wrong. He’s holding boxes of biscuits and water bottles, handing them out to students protesting for quota reform. The video shows students running through all this smoke, and some are taking the bottles from him. It’s crazy how a simple, kind act became the last thing he did. When you watch that clip, knowing what came after, it hits you right in the heart.

Mugdho, he was from Khulna University, and he got shot during the protest in Uttara on the 18th of July. I’m still struggling to understand it. He was there, just helping people, and then suddenly, bam, everything changed.

His friend, Naimur Rahman Ashiq, shared what went down that day. They heard about students getting attacked in Uttara, so Mugdho, Ashiq, and some other friends rushed there to help. Mugdho wasn’t the type to just stand back and watch. He helped carry wounded people to the hospital, doing all he could. Around 6 p.m., after handing out water and biscuits, they were chilling on a road divider. Then, outta nowhere, gunshots start coming from Rajuk commercial area. They all ran, but Mugdho didn’t make it. He was shot and just fell. They took him to Crescent Hospital, but it was too late. The doctors said he was gone.

It’s so hard to wrap my head around this. In just a few moments, someone’s whole life changes, just like that. One minute, he’s helping out, doing the right thing, and the next, he’s gone. What really gets me is he wasn’t doing anything wrong. He wasn’t violent or anything. He was just there to help, and he paid for it with his life.
Stories like this make me think how crazy and unfair life can be sometimes. Mugdho’s story reached so many people online, and I think it’s because we can all see a little of ourselves in him. We all want to stand up for what’s right, make a difference. But we don’t expect something like this to happen. His death just shows how cruel the world can be, even to good, kind-hearted people.

Mugdho didn’t deserve this. But, even in his last moments, his kindness is something we should all remember.

    description: `If I were a boy

I would be a brother to a sister.		

If I were a boy

I would be a child to a mother. 

If I were a boy

I would not be restricted from leaving the house.

If I were a boy

I would not be unsafe standing on the street at night.

If I were a boy 

I would not accept that inferior animal on the street. 

If I were a boy 

I would not get burned by the ferocity of hungry hyenas.

If I were a boy 

I would say to hyenas – “We are your sisters. We are mothers.”

If I were a boy

I would say – “Mother's caste is venerable.”

But what do you know about sadness? 

I'm not a boy, I'm a girl.

I am living with the dream of being a boy—

God's strange fun!

The unreal imagination that runs through my neurons, 

Men do not understand: 
We are very unsafe on the roads.

    description: `The four-walled test hall,

There saw you I that day 

Soon as I saw you, 

Spring breeze in my mind stirred. 

Went there I looking for my mates

In chance I met you. 

Wish I asked your name!

Alas, time rolled again on its back, fast—

Exam was over! 

Never had I chance to catch a word,  

She sat in one-two-one, column two, row five, 

And I?—in one-one-eight, column three, row ten;

Had to haul me back to one-one-eight. 

But my mind never left that room—one-two-one! 

Only wondered if we’d ever meet—again?

    title: 'A Tale of Two Twins',
    category: 'Lifestyle',
    description: `I want to share this very important story with you. It is about two brothers, but it is about much more than that. In fact, it could be about sisters, or it could be about you, even if you do not have any siblings. 

It is also about an alcoholic father, but it is about much more than an alcoholic father. You see, this story I am about to tell is relevant to everyone. Yes, you as well. 

Main Story: 
There were two brothers—twin brothers. These brothers grew up with an alcoholic father. He wasn’t just an alcoholic father, he was bitter, drunk, abusive and aggressive, verbally and physically. 

The father was the worst kind someone could be for their children and those two identical brothers watched this unfold from the moment their eyes could see and their ears could hear. They watched their father all through their childhood, their teenage years and right until they moved out of the family home. 
Unfortunately, their father never changed. The drinking never stopped though the bitterness kept growing, the anger at the world, the blame of his problems to others never ceased. 

Fast forward, many years later, the little boys have now grown into two charming young men. Their father is now in prison, arrested for his violent crimes; unfortunately, it was not the first time. Along with him incarcerated is someone else, only younger; it is none other than one of the beautiful twins! 
The mother of the twins goes to visit her son in prison, and she asks her son, “How did you end up like this?” Angered at her question, he blurts, “What choice did I have? He was a mean, drunk…” he will not finish his words. He is furious at his father for the way his life turned out. After all, his father was the model whose influence drove him down this path.

On the way home, the mother visits the other son. This twin’s life has turned out be a bit different. He has never touched a drop of alcohol in his life; he is happily married with two beautiful children, living in bliss. The mother asks this son, “How did you end up like this?”
He responds, “My father was an angry alcoholic. What choice did I have? I didn’t want that life for myself. I remember thinking after watching him, ‘That would never be me. No matter what! I wanted the opposite, for me, and my kids!’”

Moral of the Story: 
It does not matter what happens to us. It only matters what meaning we give to what happens to us. That is what shapes our lives. That is what shapes who we will become. 

We can choose to blame other people and the world for where we are in life or who we become. Unlike the brother in prison, we can view negative things as blessings, a sort of caution for what we do not want in our lives. 

As a strong reminder, it must be considered that doing better is not going to be easy, but through work on us, accepting responsibility, we can create a better world for ourselves and our families, for the people we care deeply. 

We can live in anger or bitterness and point out the world is at fault. We will not have to search long to find such examples. Instead, we can see the good in others and the good in all situations. We can trust that even the hardest of challenges are sent for our benefit if we search. Thankfully, we will not have to search long to find it. 

We can be a victim or the victor in life. 

We can see a negative in everything or the blessing in everything. We can choose to take responsibility for our actions—not the circumstances, not the horrific things people do, only our actions and reactions. 

We cannot let circumstances or other people control our lives! The only one!

    description: `

Once upon a time, there were two friends who were barely close, and they did not know much about each other. Their names were Ana and Deni. Ana thought they would be a good match and she felt relief because of finding a humble person.


So, their days were becoming colorful by the company of each other. One day, when Ana was going to her aunt's house, she saw Deni on the street and asked her what happened. Deni told Ana that some people were talking behind her and added that she had fought with them for her. Though Ana felt bad hearing that news, she was also happy to have such a good friend.


She told Deni goodbye and went to her destination. At night, when she was thinking about the day, Deni's words rushed to her mind, and out of curiosity, she asked another friend about the incident. One of her closest friends told her that she had not heard anything about the incident and also commented that what Ana had done was right. The thing is, a few days ago they had joined college, and she had created a group to stay connected with all the classmates.


One day, a boy named Joe sent a request to join the group, and she approved it. One day, while scrolling through her social media, she saw a group where she had been added by Joe. He had added her without asking. At that time, she saw that a reckless boy had sent a reel that didn't suit the environment of the group. As the admin of the group, she told him not to send this type of thing in a group where he didn’t know most of the people.


After some conversation, he said that he wouldn’t send those things anymore. But after some time, another boy sent a meme, and that was the start button. Then all the immature people started to send unsuitable messages. Seeing that, she left the group. After leaving the group, the admin of the group, Joe, messaged her and said sorry. After some days, they started to talk recklessly bad about Ana, which was informed to her by Deni. So, that was the short incident. After some days, another friend of hers sent her some screenshots of the group where they talked about Ana.


After seeing the conversation, Ana felt fooled. Her friend, Deni, who informed her about this incident, was also involved in the reckless conversations, and Deni's words were negative for Ana's image. She asked her nothing about the happenings. Not because she couldn’t get hold of her, but because she felt a vast amount of hatred for this two-faced person, whom she had loved and believed, had deceived her. Though Deni continued to send her messages and tried to talk to her in person, Ana declined the proposal. Ana just ignored her. The End. (Based on a true story).

    title: 'Whispers in the Dark',
    description: `
    I’m running recklessly, an eerie breeze howling through my ears, running too fast to control. Not knowing where I’m going, losing my balance and… I fell!
Gosh, this wakes me up. A nightmare once again. I pull out my phone to see the time—half past three. I get up to drink some water, shocked and horrified to see someone blurry sitting beside my bed with a small and timid light.


Heck, it’s my roommate studying for our thanatology exam. Aghast and frustrated with myself for what I’m doing with my life, regrets flood in from the past. I finally manage to go back to sleep by dawn… but suddenly again I had a dream in my sleep, and the dream was so real that I could feel everything around me. It was strange and quite spooky as I could see one lady sleeping on a large bed. She was talking to herself and sketching something on a notepad. The woman was old, dull, and wearing torn, blood-splattered clothes.


From somewhere, a little girl came and started making noise. She started to cry so loudly that I couldn’t handle it, and then my (roommate)-friend woke me up and told me that the exam was in an hour. Half-awake, with my clock ticking faster than my brain processing her words, a panic attack paralyzes me. I know I can’t skip it.
I open my room door, and a bright ray of sunlight falls on my table, perhaps a glimmer of hope. Then we went outside, had our breakfast, and went to our research room. There was a cadaver (a dead human body). I was shocked—it was the same old lady from my dream. I started to get panic attacks and became unconscious.
When I woke up at midnight, I found myself in the bed of our medical room. At that time, I heard someone whispering from outside, "You are not alone." I began to follow that sound but found nothing. The sound didn’t stop, and I got irritated.


In the meantime, my friend called me, asking, "Where are you going?"
I found myself on the rooftop—how I got there, I don’t know. After that night, everything was normal for several days...
Since that incident, it's been almost a month. We had just finished our yearly exams. Some of our team members decided to go on a trip. We were looking for a unique way to bond after our final exam. One of us suggested a weekend retreat to a mansion on the outskirts. We were intrigued. The mansion, a sprawling estate abandoned for decades, had been the subject of local legends about a tragic history involving a doctor who went mad.
So, all of us agreed to go there after 13 days.


We left early in the morning from the college... it was almost dark when we arrived. Upon arrival, we found the mansion both grand and decrepit. It was in an isolated village, and a crumbling mansion stood abandoned, shrouded in dark legends. One stormy night, a curious historian ventured inside, and I felt an oppressive weight settle upon us.


The grand ballroom, though covered in dust, still had an air of its former elegance. As night fell, we gathered around a fireplace in the mansion, sharing ghost stories and medical anecdotes.

The real strange thing started when one of our team members, Lisa, found a hidden door behind a tattered curtain. It led to an old medical laboratory, complete with rusty instruments and glass jars containing strange, preserved specimens. Eager to investigate, we examined the lab and discovered old patient records detailing bizarre and unethical experiments.

As the night deepened, we began experiencing unsettling occurrences: whispers in the dark, flickering lights, and strange noises. One by one, we started to feel unwell, plagued by intense nightmares of being restrained and subjected to invasive procedures.
Then came the eerie discovery.

In a corner of the lab, we found a large, dusty ledger with a crudely written entry: “To continue my work, I need new subjects.” The entries detailed experiments performed on patients, some of whom had mysteriously disappeared.
Panic set in as we realized that the mansion’s dark past might not be entirely over.
In the early hours of the morning, one of our team members, Mark, was found unconscious in the lab. He woke up with no memory of how he got there. We didn’t understand what was happening to us.


After taking our meal, we went out to view the area around the mansion. The local people lived quite far away from the mansion. We went there and had a talk with some locals, and we learned that there was a doctor who went mad and was brutally murdered. He killed so many people for his experiments and once he killed a pregnant woman with her 8-year-old child… it was his own family. After that incident, within one month, the doctor went mad, and the villagers found his dead body near a jungle by his mansion. Nobody knows how he got there… but they were sure that it was not a normal death.


From then on, sometimes the villagers hear some weird noises from that house. An old lady came to us with a picture of that family, and after seeing the picture, I was shocked—I had seen the little girl in my dream. How is THIS possible? It can't be a hallucination. It can't be any coincidence...
After hearing that, some of our team members suggested leaving immediately, but a few wanted to stay. I also wanted to stay and figure out what was happening...

    title: 'Definition of happiness ',
    description: `
   The definition of happiness varies from person to person and comes from our inner peace and contentment. For me, happiness is an abstract concept that can be found everywhere, depending on our mood. It’s not a treasure or a certificate that you have to earn by hook or by crook. Rather, it’s a state of mind. Happiness should be cherished. There are many people who possess material wealth, but they still seem dull or gloomy. The reason is often due to a lack of happiness. If you want to be happy, you must feel it. There is nothing about eyewash or pretending. When you're truly happy, it reflects in your eyes; they sparkle with the embrace of joy. 


I try to find happiness in the little things. For example, while I’m watering the garden, a butterfly might land on a flower. I pause, observe its beauty, and capture the moment in a photo, fully embracing its simple yet profound charm. That feeling is immeasurable. If you want to embrace real happiness you must understand the definition of it. I prefer small, simple things to make me happy. For instance, I might be drinking tea in a garden with a perfect novel in my hand, surrounded by the sounds of nature. I feel the beauty of the garden and take every sip of tea. These moments make my life beautiful, and no material possession, like an expensive car, could replace that. 


The happiness I feel during such moments is beyond measure. When I spend time with my parents, I see their beauty, loyalty, and care for me. That is the most priceless happiness I’ve ever experienced. In my life, I’ve chosen simple things to make me happy. If someone offers me tea at a quiet moment, I feel like I am over the moon. I find my peace and tranquility in these experience 


In conclusion, I want to say one thing: follow your heart and what it says. Don’t let others snatch your happiness. Wherever you are, remember to enjoy every moment of your life. Life is beautiful. As soon as possible find your happiness and live joyfully.

    title: 'A Precious Little Life ',
    description: `
  A sharp sting on my feet startled me awake from my sleep. The sting wasn’t painful enough to draw blood though. And without even opening my eyes, I knew the source of the pain.  As I cracked my eyes open, I sat up and picked up my cat who was busy playing with my legs. She looked at me with all excited round eyes, reflecting pure delight that I was finally awake. I pulled myself out of the blanket and carried my cat towards to kitchen to get her some food first. 


 I checked the time and it was already past 8 am. Which means both of my parents had had left for work by then. They didn’t call me before leaving. Because last night, I was up till midnight working on submitting an essay for a competition. The thought of starting the day without a glimpse of my parents instantly made my mind go dull and heavy. I couldn’t shake off the empty feeling forming in my heart. Letting out a long and steady sigh, I got fresh and tried to shove some food up my throat as I couldn’t bring myself to actually enjoy it at that moment. 


Before going to sit for study, I went to check on my birds at the balcony to make sure they had enough food and clear water. It had been a little more than seven years that I was keeping birds as my pet. The species of my bird is called ‘Budgerigars’ or ‘Budgies’ in short form. They are a little like parrot but very small in size and comes in many colors. They are very adorable and playful. I had brought up a number of pair of budgies in all those years but they had never increased in number. I had been waiting for that day to come since I was a kid, that one day while checking on my birds I’ll find a cute little baby bird in the nest. But that day never managed to come. No matter how much care I was taking of them, from making sure they were getting enough nutrition to keeping their nest warm and comfortable in the cage, none of my efforts worked out. Sometimes there were some infertile eggs in the nest, or no eggs at all. So eventually, I gave up on the hope of my birds having a baby and increase the number of their little family. 


I was so swept away in my thought, and my cat’s meow brought me back to reality. Well, it had really been pretty long since I last checked the nest. Even though I knew I’ll be disappointed all over again, I peered into the nest. I found the female bird sitting inside the nest.  She probably has laid some more infertile eggs, I thought. I was going to close the door of the cage when I noticed something like a green feather peeking under my white female bird. I leaned lower to get a closer look. Then the mother bird moved aside, REVEALING A GREEN LITTLE BABY!!! Oh My God! It was So much of an emotion to take in. My cat was looking at me confused because, feeling overwhelmed I had probably screamed out of joy. I was shaking with excitement as I called my mother to give her the news. She was also as happy as me and I instantly sent her some pictures and videos of the baby. 


When my parents came home, they made sure the baby was healthy and all of us were taking extra care of the birds. The baby was growing up really fast. The day the baby first came out of the nest, he was looking everywhere inside the cage with rounded eyes like it was the biggest house on earth. When all of its feather were done growing, it came out exactly like its father. And by the color of its nose, I knew that he was a boy. The little one month old baby bird was loved by so many hearts. My mom often let him out of the cage to explore. My cute little baby bird would explore the house while I locked my cat away. Even though my cat grew up with birds, no predator can ever be trusted near its prey. 


The baby bird also loved my cat. Whenever he saw the cat entering the balcony, he would stand at the edge of the cage and start chatting with her with his head tilted. But I never leave my cat alone with the birds. I always used to keep the door of the balcony closed and my entire family was instructed to do so. I needed to make sure that my birds were safe from any kind of threats. 


Days went by and my baby bird was growing up surrounded by love. He was then two months old. He wasn’t ready to fly yet. It was a typical Tuesday. I came back from college and found my mother home. But there was something unusual about the way she looked at me. There was hurt and pain all over her face and a sign of guilt. My heart jumped with anxiety thinking what might have happened. Mother brought the dead baby bird. There was blood all over his little head. The cat scratched his head with her nails when my precious little baby was standing by the edge of the cage, all excited to greet her.  


Everything hurt. It was the sort of pain that made it hard to breathe. The baby couldn’t even learn to fly! He was probably standing with disbelief when his forever best friend scratched his head. SO MUCH PAIN. That tiny little baby suffered so much pain that he never deserved. He was supposed to be the heart of our home flying around the rooms. His life wasn’t supposed to end like that. These thoughts made me cry harder. I was crying until I couldn’t see straight. I failed! A voice spoke inside my head. I failed to protect the bird. It wasn’t the cat’s fault. If only I was home that day? Or I warned them several times more about being careful about the balcony door? Could the baby still be alive then? I failed to protect the precious little life.

 Mother
You are the sparkle of the moon,

A decorative lamp in my life,

Burning among thousands of candles—

You are the picture that

Blooms among thousands of flowers.

You are the happiness clinging to thousands of storms,

With which my chest is filled.

Your love is not a love

That will ever leave.

If the word love is blessed,

I will say it only for you.

I am enchanted, I love you.

I love to stay in your shadow

All my life.

Your smile is the moon that has broken the dam,

Light after light.

Mother,

My mind is good remembering you.

Mother,

Don’t leave me.

Without you, I am a stranger—

No one cares like you.

When I see your magical face,

My heart calls for you,

And the hum of the sea surrenders.

That magical smile of yours

Will succumb to the vast waters of the sea.

Be in protest against injustice,

You are in struggle.

I am educated in your education;

You are the one who taught me how to read

And how to do math.

Little sands, little water—

I am in love with you; I am the abyss.

Birth loses to death,

Lies lose to truth.

Mother,

I lose to you.

If blessed is ever in action,

This is just for you.

I am imprisoned in the shadow

Of the green forest of your love.

I am the melody of your beautiful voice.

Do you know this story?

That magical face of yours

Fills all the happiness in the world.

You are the blooming flower beneath

The dark green leaves.

You come and catch all my mistakes.

Whenever I fall into a dilemma,

Your soft lips speak silently.

You are the rhythm in my poem.

I am proud to be born in your arms.

You are my dewy grass.

If I don’t see you for a moment,

My breath stops.

You rule me as a rebel;

Magical maternal love made more interested.

I will keep you as a queen in my heart.

Mother,

Will you give me some space at your feet?

Never let go of this hand of mine,

No matter how dangerous it may be.

Can I ever forget this endless debt of yours?

If ever this body of mine is buried,

Immortal be the title you gave me.

    title: 'Brain Drain in Bangladesh',
    description: `
  Brain drain is a big problem for developing countries like Bangladesh. It slows down the development of our country and takes away our peace and happiness. It is also destroying the future of the next generation, creating a very dangerous situation. If this continues, we won’t be able to maintain a proper democracy.


Brain drain happens when intelligent students don’t get the right opportunities for higher education in their own country. With no other choice, they are forced to go abroad for better education. Our education system is partly to blame because it doesn’t meet the needs of these talented students. When they go abroad, they find better opportunities, and their intelligence is appreciated. After that, they don’t think about coming back to Bangladesh, and this causes our country to fall behind.

On top of that, when countries are ruled by dictators, people lose their right to speak freely, making the situation worse. However, some brave students are still studying in Bangladesh. Last month, they gathered students from across the country to protest peacefully against the dictatorship of Hasina. Sadly, more than 1,000 students were killed during the protests because the police fired on them following her orders. Many of those students were bright minds who could have played a major role in creating a better country.

On August 5th, after 16 long years, Bangladesh gained its true independence with the fall of dictator Hasina, thanks to these brave students. Now, people can speak out without fear, and the intelligent students are running the country peacefully. People now understand that real progress can’t happen without the involvement of students.

To stop brain drain, we need to appreciate talented students in our own country. The education system should be changed to grade students fairly, and corruption in both education and the job market must be stopped. Jobs should be given based on qualifications, not bribes. If we don’t make these changes, another dictator might rise, and we could lose our freedom of speech again.

Therefore, it’s important for the government to encourage talented students to stay in Bangladesh and pursue higher education here. The government must offer them better opportunities, so they don’t feel the need to leave. If we can do that, we can stop brain drain and create a peaceful and developed country.

    title: 'Diary of the Sick',
    description: `
I wanted to be sick all the time because I thought that way I wouldn’t have to do the house chores. That sick hobby of mine soon faded away. The reason was my dearest person’s passing. He was diagnosed with cancer. He was the strongest person I ever saw in my life. On 13.05.2016, he first told us about his chest pain. I don’t remember him walking me to school after that day.

It was quite upsetting for me, but I grew out of it. Then suddenly, many of my relatives started coming to our house at random. My exam was approaching, but my mom was not there because she had taken him to India for better treatment. I was annoyed at how my scores started to fall, and for the first time, I failed in one subject. The reason was probably my mom not being with me, or my relatives and other guests I had never seen before making me lose my concentration. I don’t know why, but I started to feel really annoyed, and maybe my siblings did too.

After 5 months, they came back with no improvement. I got frustrated. I started ignoring him. Was I too young, or was it my mentality? I don’t remember, and I don’t want to. The guilt still clenches me. My throat tightens whenever that memory flashes before my eyes. I remember my mom crying alone because she knew something that we didn’t. Another 4 months passed. Tomorrow is my final exam. I can’t sleep on the floor. My back hurts. Some people I don’t know are lying on my bed wide awake. They’re crying silently. I didn’t want to fail that exam, but I couldn’t sleep either.

When my eyes finally closed, some faint voices started calling for me. It was my sibling. The voices started to become clear. I woke up lazily. They started crying loudly. I got annoyed and thought, why would they cry so much when I knew he wouldn’t die. I knew he was strong enough to fight back. I knew he wouldn’t leave us. He was lying on one side of the bed, and I was at the corner sitting. I looked at him closely after so long that my words got stuck in my mouth. His body was so skinny that it felt like his skin was disturbingly attached to his bones.

I still had faith in him. Everyone was sobbing. But the voices became faint. A tear escaped my eye unknowingly. The guilt started gushing through me. I felt empty. I wanted to make sure that he didn’t leave us, but I couldn’t move and started observing everyone. I had hope in my eyes that maybe there would be someone who would assure me that everything was fine. It was a dream, but my dad’s reaction showed it all. Then it all just stopped. My hope, the clock, and his heartbeat. On 13.03.2017, at 3:20 am, my Dadabhai left us behind.

    title: 'About Being Creative',
    description: `
Creativeness can come naturally or forcefully. But there’s also one thing that not many people told you about. It’s stealing. Feels wrong but it’s the gospel. Every artist gets asked “where do you get your ideas from?” If the artist is honest he’ll reply with “I steal them” Now if you ask me how to steal then I’m going to say look around yourself and find what’s worth stealing, then you move on the next thing. If you don’t find something worth stealing today you might find it tomorrow or a month or even a year later.

As the French writer André Gide put it “Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again” Now if you may ask what’s originality then the English writer William Ralph Inge’s going to say “Undetected plagiarism” If you feel like that you’re doing something wrong then mark the words of Mark Twain who said “It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected “ All you have to do is copy copy and copy until you find your true self.

We’re talking about practice here, not plagiarism—plagiarism is trying to pass someone else’s work off as your own. Copying is about reverse engineering. It’s like a machine taking apart a car to see how it works. Remember even The Beatles started as a cover band. First you have to figure out who to copy. Second, you must figure out what to copy. Who to copy is easy. You copy your heroes. What to copy is a little bit trickier. Don’t just steal the style but steal the thinking behind the style. All you have to do is unlock your creativity.

    title: 'A time when I was challenged and how I faced it',
    description: `
One of the biggest challenges I ever faced in my life was moving to the city for my education, and it taught me to stay strong to confront my obstacles. I am basically from a village, not from the city. I always wanted to pursue higher education. That's why I enrolled in a college located in the city. As a girl from the village, it wasn't an easy task for me.

I was commuting from my village to college, and it was a long journey. After traveling, I couldn't focus on my studies. Besides that, my parents, who are not highly educated, didn’t understand the situation, but they were trying their best to figure something out. However, I had a few relatives in the city, although we were not well acquainted. If I went there as a guest, they might have received me cordially, but if I went there to stay, it wouldn't be convenient for them. So, we didn’t think it was okay to bother them.

At that time, I felt like I was the only one struggling, while all my classmates were already settled. Their tuition and accommodations were figured out. At this stage of life, I realized the importance of having some good connections in the city. Two months after I got admitted to college, I made a friend, and I talked to her about my situation. She told me that she had found a place to live and suggested that I join her. I gave it some thought and went to check the place out. Luckily, I liked it. Though the place was simple, at that time, I was too desperate for a place to stay.

I remembered the proverb, "Something is better than nothing." I consulted with my father, and he agreed to send me here. Fortunately, this is the place where I am staying now. I am really grateful to her. That was a very challenging moment for me because I had to find a place all by myself. It was difficult, especially when everyone else around me seemed settled, while I was struggling. That was pathetic! In the end, I can say that challenges are an integral part of life. One more thing—there is no way to escape from them.

The real heroes are the ones who overcome their challenges on their own. Honestly, now I feel like I am much tougher than before. I was once a girl who depended on her parents for every little thing, but now I face challenges daily. For instance, I am adjusting to a new place and new people. Consequently, those challenges have made me stronger and more capable. In conclusion, I want to say we all need to learn how to overcome challenges in our lives.

We are familiar with various types of pollution and are working tirelessly day and night to combat them. We may mention types of pollution like air pollution, soil pollution, and water pollution, which can cause cancer, damage the skin, and much more.

These hinder our longevity, right? But what if I say there is another form of pollution in our country—Bangladesh—that is far more dangerous? Yeah, you heard right. I am talking about lead pollution. The most dangerous part of the problem is that it affects our nervous system. It damages our brain and completely destroys our creativity.

The effects of lead poisoning are gradual but certain. Historically, the Roman Empire is believed to have declined due to the extensive use of lead. Sadly, many people in our country are being affected by this problem. But they are not getting proper treatment because this issue is not widely known or properly introduced to most people. Isn't it something to think about? I am writing this to make people aware of the problem, as it is one of the most talked-about topics in other countries.

    description: `
There are numerous memories from my school life that I made with my school friends. My school life was very enjoyable because of my friends and the school environment. I started going to school in 2019 and finished in 2024. I spent five years wearing my school uniform. When I was very young in school, I tried to attend class regularly. Day by day, I made some friends in school.

During leisure periods, I played cricket and football with my friends, and I spent time in the library. As I was promoted to the next year and got older, I communicated more closely with my classmates. But I had some friends in school who were my besties. They were the main reason I enjoyed going to school. We shared our expressions, thoughts, ideas, and goals with each other.


One of the best memories of my school life was playing football on a rainy day with my friends. Another was eating snacks, chips, and fast food with friends in the school canteen, which was one of the most beautiful experiences. We would contribute money together to buy food in the canteen. It was an exhilarating experience eating with my friends. We spent most of our school life gossiping.

Sometimes we even bunked school. As our SSC exam approached, we started preparing hard for it. After the SSC exam ended, all my friends and I started walking from the exam center. It was our last get-together. We took a group photo to remember our bond.

    title: 'The Power of Self-Employment',
    description: `
“The Entrepreneur builds an enterprise; The Technician builds a job.”
-Michael Gerber

In today’s world, there are many competitors in the job market. Among them, only a few people get the chance in this competition, and those who don’t succeed often end up in depression. This causes unemployment and has a dire impact on the country’s economy. So, I would prefer to build my career through self-employment. In this way, a person can be self-reliant. A person’s ability to self-actualize increases through self-fulfillment. Even doing any work can make you feel cheerful, and self-confidence also increases by implementing that work well. You will be able to create employment by developing something new through your own creativity. Not only will you benefit yourself, but you can also give many others the opportunity to work in your employment. In addition to this, you can also improve your financial status. By doing this, there will be a massive improvement in the country’s economy, and the nation will also prosper.


I believe there are no binding rules in this sector. You can work according to your own thoughts, with no fear of job loss. It is very necessary to learn about self-employment from our student life so that we don’t have to face any hassle regarding this in the future. But unfortunately, our institutions are not giving us the knowledge of self-employment.

As a result, most students may not be aware of this topic. Students should know these mandatory things and develop their skills. In the age of the internet, you can easily develop your skills in any subject with the help of various websites and YouTube channels. By doing this, we can take the country to an extraordinary level. If we have the will, we can do many things and overcome all obstacles. But if we don’t have the desire to do it, then we can’t succeed, even if we have everything in our hands...

    title: 'Beginning of the nightmare',
    description: `
I’m running recklessly, an eerie breeze howling through my ears, running too fast to control. Not knowing where I’m going, I lose my balance and… I fall!

Gosh, this wakes me up. A nightmare once again. I pull out my phone to see the time—half past three. I get up to drink some water, shocked and horrified to see someone blurry sitting beside my bed with a small, timid light. Heck, it’s my roommate studying for our thanatology exam. Aghast and frustrated with myself for what I’m doing with my life, regrets from the past flood in. I finally manage to go back to sleep by dawn, but suddenly, I have a dream that is so real I can feel everything around me. It’s strange and quite spooky; I see a woman sleeping on a large bed. She’s talking to herself and sketching something on a notepad. The woman is old, dull, and wearing torn, blood-splattered clothes.

From somewhere, a little girl appears and starts making so much noise, crying so loudly that I can’t handle it. My roommate-friend wakes me up and tells me the exam is in an hour. Half-awake, my clock ticking faster than my brain processes her words, panic attack paralyzes me. I know I can’t skip it.

I open my room door, and a bright ray of sunlight falls on my table, perhaps a glimmer of hope. We go outside, have breakfast, and head to our research room. There, I’m shocked to find a cadaver (a dead human body). It’s the same old lady from my dream. I start to panic and become unconscious.

When I wake up at midnight, I find myself in the medical room’s bed. I hear someone whispering from outside, “You are not alone.” I begin to follow the sound but find nothing. The sound doesn’t stop, and I get irritated. Meanwhile, my friend calls me, asking where I’m going. I find myself on the rooftop without knowing how I got there. After that night, everything was normal for several days.

Since that incident, it’s been almost a month. We had just finished our yearly exams. Some of our team members decided to go on a trip, looking for a unique way to bond after our final exams. One of us suggested a weekend retreat to a mansion on the outskirts, which intrigued us. The mansion, a sprawling estate abandoned for decades, had been the subject of local legends about a tragic history involving a doctor who went mad.

We all agreed to go there after 13 days. We left early in the morning from college. It was almost dark by the time we arrived. The mansion was both grand and decrepit, located in an isolated village. A crumbling mansion stood abandoned, shrouded in dark legends. One stormy night, a curious historian ventured inside, and I felt an oppressive weight settle upon us.

The grand ballroom, though covered in dust, still had an air of its former elegance. As night fell, we gathered around a fireplace in the mansion, sharing ghost stories and medical anecdotes.

The strange events began when one of our team members, Lisa, found a hidden door behind a tattered curtain. It led to an old medical laboratory, complete with rusty instruments and glass jars containing strange, preserved specimens. Eager to investigate, we examined the lab and discovered old patient records detailing bizarre and unethical experiments.

As the night deepened, we began experiencing unsettling occurrences: whispers in the dark, flickering lights, and strange noises. One by one, we started to feel unwell, plagued by intense nightmares of being restrained and subjected to invasive procedures.

Then came the eerie discovery. In a corner of the lab, we found a large, dusty ledger with a crudely written entry: “To continue my work, I need new subjects.” The entries detailed experiments performed on patients, some of whom had mysteriously disappeared. Panic set in as we realized that the mansion’s dark past might not be entirely over.

In the early hours of the morning, one of our team members, Mark, was found unconscious in the lab. He woke up with no memory of how he got there. We didn’t understand what was happening to us.

After taking a meal, we went outside to explore the mansion. The local people lived quite far away from the mansion. We went to talk with some locals and learned that the doctor who went mad was brutally murdered. He killed many people for his experiments, including his pregnant wife and 8-year-old child—his own family. After that incident, within a month, the doctor went mad, and the villagers found his dead body near a jungle by his mansion. Nobody knows how he ended up there, but they were sure it was not a normal death. Since then, villagers have occasionally heard strange noises from the house. An old lady showed us a picture of that family. I was shocked to see the little girl from my dream. How is this possible? It can’t be a hallucination or coincidence.

After hearing this, some of our team members wanted to leave immediately, while a few of us wanted to stay and uncover what was happening.
To be continued...

    title: 'Some Little Things Called Happiness',
    description: `
Happiness is a relative term. The definition of happiness varies from person to person. From my point of view, happiness is something that makes you feel alive, something that gives you peace of mind. Happiness lies in the little things, the simplest gestures & the smallest moments of life. Different people feel happiness for different reasons. Hence, everyone has their own causes of Euphoria. Rather than confining happiness within words, I would rather depict happiness through some scenarios of my genuine happy moments.

Speaking about the night of 21st February 2024. It was certainly the best night of my life so far. I was over the moon. On that very night, I went to the rooftop & laid down there. The night was just perfect. There was a cool breeze. The moon was shining so bright. There were countless stars in the sky. I stared at the moon & the night sky full of stars to my heart's content while the cool breeze was hitting me. I felt goosebumps. I was humming my favourite songs while enjoying myself alone. Everything felt so peaceful that I  wanted to be stuck there forever. I have always been an ardent admirer of Luna(in Latin, the moon is called Luna). Every time I see her, my mood magically lightens up no matter what I'm going through. Maybe I'm someone beyond just a selenophile. I just can't write down all the emotions I felt at that moment. I felt alive again that night. I had an epiphany that life is worth it. That's what I consider happiness.

I'm the happiest whenever it rains. Hearing the sound of rain makes me feel at home. I'll forever be so in love with the rain. I'm an enthusiast of rain for Duas made during the rain are not rejected. I just whine like a baby to Allah (SWT) claiming my favourite things as soon as it rains. Sitting near the window or the balcony,  I enjoy watching the cloudy sky, the raindrops hitting the ground's surface & letting my hands get wet in the rain. It gives me peace, comfort & warmth. In the afternoon of 27 July 2024,it was raining cats & dogs. All I wanted was to get drenched in that rain. I went to the rooftop as wished. The moment the raindrops touched my skin I felt overwhelmed. There was heavy wind too. I haven’t been that happy in ages. In no time, my younger siblings joined me too. We had so much fun. We jumped in the water, splashing each other. I laughed so hard that day. I was beyond happy. I felt so at ease as if I belonged under the rain. This is my kind of happiness.

Since childhood, I always have wondered what it feels like to ride a boat. & I finally got to experience this the other day. There is a large field on the backside of our house & it was overflowing with the water from the recent flood. It was August 31, 2024, & we family members went on sailing together for the very first time. My father was the one who rowed the wooden boat. It was a sunny morning, but a gentle breeze was blowing to add to our comfort & enjoyment. The ripples of the water were making a sweet murmuring sound. The sunlight reflecting off the water created sparks, igniting the surface of the water. Birds were flying over our heads. We saw Kingfishers diving into the water to catch fish while my father was rowing the boat at fast speed, making it more thrilling. Let me share a secret, we again went on sailing later in the night at 10 PM. It felt so peaceful to ride a boat at night. The sky was sparkling with countless stars. We rode the boat at least 10 times. Once it was the time of sunset. We saw the sun floating towards the horizon. The crimson rays of the setting sun enhanced the beauty of nature. On 13th September, we went on sailing in the afternoon in rainy weather.  No sooner had we commenced on than the raindrops started falling. We were sailing away while drenching in the rain. It was a miraculous moment. It will remain a lifetime experience. If this is not Happiness, then what is?

Smeraldo flower represents - The truth I could not tell. As an INFJ I have always been bad at vocal. My mind is filled with eloquent words that can't be spoken out loud, only written. I'm always praised for being a good listener. But the listener needs a listener too, right? & who can be the best listener other than The As - Samee (The all hearing) , My beloved ALLAH (SWT)? I have several diaries where I write on different topics. Two of them are named  "The Truth Untold" & "Whispers of The Heart".  All my unspoken words, untold truths, heartbreaks, setbacks, wishes are written there. & I write most of them addressing Allah (swt). It gives me another level of happiness to write to Him. All my anxieties fade away once I write them down. Writing helps me clear my mind & makes me happy. My diary might not be one like Anne Frank's, but all my experiences, thoughts, dreams & feelings shape who I am and are a valuable record of my journey and a reminder of how far I've come.

Life doesn’t always go with the flow we want.
Life is full of ebbs & flows. There are days when we feel so low, we lose our most precious things, we face hardships. But I don’t lose hope in such situations . Allah (swt) says in The Quran : Your Lord has proclaimed, “Call upon Me, I will respond to you." (Quran 40:60)
My Lord has promised to respond to me. What can be more comforting than this?
I always make dua whenever I face hardships & I wait until Allah(swt) responds to me, until it turns zero o’clock. Here Zero o’clock is a metaphor of the time Allah(swt) responds. 
At times Allah(swt) responses to my dua instantaneously. I ask for a flower & He blesses me with a whole garden. Every door seems closed but He is the one who opens doors, doors I didn’t even know existed. He provides me from sources I could never imagine. He makes the impossible possible. 
& what could be more blissful than getting responses from your Rabb? I cry out of happiness whenever Allah(swt) responses to my duas. There are some feelings that are difficult to describe, the happiness I feel when He responds me is one of those undescribable feelings.

When I look back to the days I was a kid, I think about all of my childhood memories.
Amongst them, the ones of my nanubari are favourites. Sometimes I just wanna go back to those Golden Days. We cousins used to play around here and there. We used to roam around so many places. In winter, there was a special place where we all used to go and soak in all the beauty of the surrounding landscape. The place is mustard fields. But now so many things have changed. We hardly get together. Still, one thing is unchanged till now or you can say it’s increasing way deeper & that is the love I share with my grandparents. On December 2022, We were at nanubari to enjoy our winter vacation. My aunts, uncles & cousins were also there. It was the afternoon of 17th December 2022, we went out for refreshment & found a mustard field. I was awestruck & It felt so nostalgic. It reminded me of my childhood. I can reminisce everything. The memories I made there are the ones that I'll cherish for the rest of my life. Even thinking of these gives me an immense amount of happiness.

Eid has always been the most awaited and exciting event for me. As a kid, the most exciting part of Eid, for me, was going to NanuBari. It feels like only the other day I was a kid.Time, you old gypsy man! 
Every Eid at NanuBari, a familiar whine would escape my lips, a yearning for the bustling market. Nanavai really loved to take us cousins to a trip to the market. There was a special shop that stole my heart year after year. Its shelves overflowed with a kaleidoscope and vivid collections of Eid cards. Nanavai always knew how to make Eid at NanuBari even more special. He'd pick out the perfect Eid card for us. It was a small gesture, yet it felt like the most precious gift.
Each one, bursting with bright colors and festive designs, seemed made just for my smile.  They were little things, but they made those Eid vacations unforgettable.
Time, like the relentless tide, washed away traditions. One Eid, I went to the familiar shop but there were no Eid cards anymore. I still remember I had sulked the whole day. There was a competition of making Eid cards last Eid-ul-Fitr. Out of my love for eid cards, I worked so hard to make a beautiful Eid card. From gathering ideas to turning them into reality, I put so much effort. & eventually, the Eid Card turned out mesmerising in 2 days on 9th April 2024. I won that competition too. While making the Eid card, a smile tugged at the corners of my lips. It was truly made with love. In French, fait avec amour means made with love.

I love keeping photographs. I capture every moment that will be a beautiful memory to remember. I also pay more attention to the moments around me, natural moments like sunrises, sunsets, fog, rain and so on. When I scroll from image to image I feel so much. My lips curve into a genuine smile & I remember what had happened the moment I took that one selfie wearing my favourite sweater. I am taken back to my cherished memories when I see my photos with my bestie. I feel a rush of adrenaline when I come across some old photos. So I find happiness in capturing little moments. I sometimes film myself doing something. At times, I film myself describing my day, something that happened lately. I love documenting myself. Taking pictures of the little things or recording myself is a way for my life documentary. These are the archives of my teenage. These will be something to hold onto as I grow old. Maybe someday in my 
60s I will remember my young days, I can hear my teenage voice again, I can show my grandchildren my teenage era through these. Indeed, Forever is a word meant for memories, so are Pictures.

Having new books is another form of happiness. I always used to wait for the new year to come, for I'll get new books. In my school days, I was always excited to know what's there in the new books, what stories they contain. The smell of new books will always remain one of my most favourite smells. There is another kind of happiness in reading various kinds of books alongside textual books.They allow me to experience a whole new world.In books, I find solace, joy & a lifelong companion. They provide me with a perfect escape from reality. Some books are so close to my heart that I find myself revisiting them after a while, to feel those emotions again.

I had never stayed away from my family except a day when I was at my nanubari. Last year when I admitted to college, I had to leave my home. It was really difficult for me to stay away from my parents & home. I felt so vulnerable at that time. I cried my heart out. Everything felt so messed up. It made me realize the world doesn’t revolve the way I used to think. I realised how hard life is & yearned for going back home so much. However, after 5 days, I finally came home. Those 5 days felt like 5 years. The happiness I felt while coming back home cannot be described. I was even happier when I finally got to see my family members. I was craving for homemade food & Ammu cooked my favourite foods for me. I was so happy to sleep in my room again. I was so happy to go to the rooftop to see the moon again. Everything feels so serene here. Every single thing of my house is known to me, but when I come back home, every detail feels so new & thrilling as if I'm new here. I now realise how precious those little moments with my family are.

Serendipity means finding something pleasant without looking for it. Life is so unpredictable & full of surprises. Whenever I come home, my little cousins bring flowers for me. This little gesture is so endearing. The fact that I love flowers & them bringing flowers, especially for me, makes me feel so special & loved. There are many people around me who genuinely adore me. They occasionally give me presents. They are always there in my hard times & try their best to help me. And it makes me happy knowing that they care for me, they care enough to spend a part of their time for me. Being treated well without asking for it means a lot. These gestures are what happiness is about.

Winter & Spring are seasons that hold a special place in my heart. I always wait for these seasons to come. I just love the vibe of these seasons. I like those wintry afternoons when it’s getting dark outside early & I'm sitting inside wearing my favourite cardigan or hoodie. It feels so peaceful and cozy to snuggle under the blanket in wintery nights & sleep like a winter bear. I love those foggy mornings. Winter brings me joy & comfort and I always feel a sense of warmth and happiness during this time of the year. I would love to wait until the spring day comes again, until the flower blooms again. In spring, the nature comes alive again with color, sound and energy. From the birds chirping, new leaves growing to the wildflowers blooming, I love everything about spring. These are my happy moments of life. Indeed, the most beautiful moment of life is yet to come.

Happiness is subjective. It's the simple joys like spending time with kids or cats, enjoying a beautiful sunset or wearing your favourite dress. Painting makes me happy. Cooking & eating noodles bring me joy. I get excited when I get updates on my online purchase. I love to go out for shopping. I'm super happy when I find the perfect shade of lipstick I was looking for. My bucket fills when I bring a smile to a stranger's face by helping. I feel euphoric to buy new dresses, shoes, sweaters or accessories. A pretty sky makes me smile. Watching birds fly makes me happy. Happiness is achieved by having positive thinking & noticing the little things of life. Be grateful to The Creator for all the blessings & your life will be spontaneously happy.

Having a beautiful coffee corner is like therapy for a coffee lover. Whenever they feel low, they can stay there and find peace. When my favorite person gives me flowers, I feel peaceful for a moment. When I can’t find anyone to talk to, I write in my diary. By doing this, I talk with myself, and it makes me feel lighter. I have a favorite water bottle, and every time I look at it, I smile for a moment.

Once, my mom gave me a houseplant for my room. Whenever I see it, I feel bold and more focused on my goals. I'm not a great artist, but I love painting. It makes me feel chaotic for a while. At this age, I normally face a lot of problems in school and college. When I talk about my teenage problems with my dad, he takes me out for lunch. It means a lot to me, and I gain energy from him to tackle my problems. My mom once bought me a perfume.Whenever I smell it, it makes me feel calm and fresh.

I have some pictures and videos from my childhood and school life. These beautiful memories remind me to be bold. In my school life, I discovered some peaceful places. Whenever I felt bored, I would go to those places and experience the freshness of nature. Going there made me feel like I was exposing my inner self. All of these things make me happy and act as therapy for me. Like these, we all have different types of therapy in our daily lives. Sometimes, we feel the emotion and heal in the moment; other times, we don't.

I’ve also experienced the feeling of therapy from several people at this young age. My first therapist, I feel, is my best friend. I met her a few years ago, and she helps me find the best option in every situation. She can make me happy in a moment. I gave her the title of therapist because I felt she had that ability. I think of her as a sister from another mother.

Furthermore, I love my mom as a therapist. She has a magical radiance in her voice and face. She can make me feel like the best person in the world. Every time I look at her and hear her voice, I experience the most peaceful moment of my life. I can’t even express that feeling properly. In addition, there is another person who recently came into my life. I call him my brother, and he calls me his sister. If I can’t have my best friend or my mom in any situation, he can be the best option for helping me make decisions. It feels like God blessed me with these people in my life.

Basically, we experience therapy from people. We often think only a person can be a therapist. But not only people, even the smallest things can be our therapeutic partners. In conclusion, I want to say that I also want to be a therapist in someone’s life. Being a therapist is a highly valued role. So, if someone addresses me as their personal therapist, I will be grateful to God.

    title: 'A Love Story',
    description: `
The date was 03-02-2022. The girl's name was Samia. I first saw her at the math coaching center. I was in class nine at school, and she was in class nine at a madrasa. Every day, I used to arrive at the coaching center early just to see her because Samia always sat at the first table. She had a good friend named Irene.

I used to look at the teacher while he was teaching, pretending to pay attention. But somehow, just seeing Samia brought me a sense of peace. However, when I tried to speak to her, I couldn’t say a word. Despite this, I loved her deeply. A few days later, I learned from my friends that Samia had a boyfriend and was in a relationship.
I was heartbroken when I heard this, but the first love of life is not easily forgotten. Gradually, Samia came to know about my feelings. Since then, she started attending the coaching classes less frequently.

One day, suddenly, Irene asked for my phone number and Facebook ID. She said, "Samia wants them." That night, I received a call from an unknown number. Without a word being spoken, I knew it was Samia. Later, she called again at 11 pm and introduced herself. We talked for a long time. Suddenly, she mentioned that the next day was Valentine's Day.

I said, "Yes, I know."

Samia said, "Will you meet me tomorrow?"

I asked, "Why?" I wasn’t prepared for what she said next.

She said, "I love you so much, but don’t bring me a rose." Hearing that, my heart skipped a beat.

I agreed and said, "Okay, I’ll be in front of the coaching center at 7 am tomorrow." She replied, "Okay."

The date was 14-02-2022. I left for the coaching center at 7 am with 10 roses in hand. After about an hour, my queen arrived, dressed in a beautiful blue saree—my favorite color. I felt as if I had found a new purpose in life. I gave her the flowers, and she was very happy. We spent the entire day together, walking around and talking. In the evening, I accompanied her to her home.

Our love lasted for two months. During this time, I had almost forgotten that she had a past. One day, I asked her about it, but she didn’t answer. She only said, "Now, you are my everything." No guy would like to hear that.

Things went on like this until, one day, she suddenly disappeared. There was no news of her. I searched everywhere but couldn’t find her. It felt like my life had come to a standstill.

One day, while traveling to Dhaka, I saw her on the Asia Aircon bus. She was with another man, holding a baby in her arms. I didn’t have to think twice to understand what had happened. Everything became clear.

From that moment on, I promised myself I would never love again. I would focus on building my career and getting married someday. But first love is not so easily forgotten.

    title: 'Understanding the LGBT Community',
    description: `
This is Nahida Koli. Today, I am going to write about a different topic. I don’t know how everyone will react to this topic. The topic is about the LGBT community. Most people don't know much about this community, so I will try my best to explain it in simple terms. I believe everyone should know what LGBT is,where it originated, and how it has evolved.

Let’s start: LGBT is an acronym for a group of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. The LGBT community is welcoming of differences. Unfortunately, society is not as accepting of the LGBT community. They face discrimination based on the preconceived notions that society holds against them. Society has many opinions on social norms, especially regarding gender roles. Society has specific expectations about how males and females should dress and act. If a person behaves outside these norms, they are likely to face criticism. Men may get criticized for not dressing or acting "masculine," and women may be criticized for not being "ladylike."

One particular group of people from the LGBT community that is heavily discriminated against is transgender people. Transgender is defined as a person whose gender identity differs from the one assigned to them at birth. As bad as it sounds, being transgender often means facing societal stigmatization, a lack of support from friends, and numerous forms of discrimination. The lack of access to supportive mental and physical healthcare is also a significant issue.

Being transgender is looked down upon in society, and they tend not to be accepted by family and friends. The Philippines, the United States, and Israel have the highest percentage of people identifying as LGBT, at 11 percent, while Thailand and Canada come in a close second place with 10 percent of adults, followed by Sweden and Brazil. In the United States, 3 percent of respondents identified as gay, 6 percent as bisexual, and 1 percent as pansexual. At the lower end of the spectrum, South Korea and Romania each have 3 percent of adults identifying as LGBT.

"Members within the LGBT community experience mental health problems at disproportionate rates compared to the general population" (LGBT Foundation, 2019). This tweet by the LGBT Foundation shows that nearly 2% of the LGBT group experienced depression last year. The percentage of LGBT youth indicates that public support does not provide an adequate response for teenagers. While the situation of LGBT youth is a significant issue in current society, mental illness among them has increased dramatically in the past decade. From a sociological and psychological perspective, mental health disorders such as suicide and depression arise from the following causes: a lack of institutional support in schools, social exclusion, fear of family rejection, and a lack of interpersonal skills.

Most people do not become LGBT members because of depression. It's a common misconception to think that being LGBT is related to mental health issues or that they try to join this community out of curiosity. The community members are not trying to increase the number of LGBT people; they are advocating for acceptance and rights.

In this generation, many children use mobile phones for education or watching cartoons, but sometimes they may accidentally view adult content. Unfortunately, when community members or others create misleading narratives and spread them on the internet, it can impact teenagers’ understanding. Day by day, some people may develop misconceptions about this community. So, parents should be vigilant and guide their children.

Homosexuality is illegal under Bangladeshi law. Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority country, and Islamic countries generally do not welcome members of this community. Every holy book, such as the Quran, the Bible, and the Gita, states that the LGBT community is haram or forbidden. Religious teachings emphasize traditional gender roles and reproduction. They argue that LGBT relationships disrupt societal norms, as members cannot procreate. If everyone were to adopt such lifestyles, it is feared that the world would be affected negatively, as reproduction would be hindered.

I tried my best to explain the topic of LGBT simply. All of us should know about this community—not necessarily to endorse it, but to be informed so that we can guide future generations effectively.
For now, that’s it.

    title: 'An Unspoken Love',
    description: `
Love can be forgotten, but if you truly love someone, their name remains somewhere in your heart.

My name is Siam. When I was six, my mother enrolled me in a nursery school. I didn't understand much at the time, but I remember having a friend who lived next door. Since then, I knew her and exchanged a few words whenever we met.

After completing nursery and kindergarten, we got admitted to the first grade, and that’s how our days began. After about two years, around 2016, her parents, along with her elder brother, moved to the city so she could attend a good educational institution. I didn’t know how I would live without her or what I would do, but I didn’t understand much at that age.

I continued studying at the same school for two years without her. When I reached fifth grade and started attending a private school, I suddenly heard that she was coming back home. Two months later, they moved back, and she met me on her first day. I was very nervous and thought she might have forgotten me, but I was wrong—she remembered me just as I was. Then, we both got admitted to the same private school and continued our studies together.

After the final exam in fifth grade, we got admitted to two different schools. Due to the pressure of studying, we lost touch. Another three years passed like that.
In 2022, we entered ninth grade. Both of us chose the science stream. There was a good teacher in our village, so we started studying with him. Her parents didn’t allow her to go alone to the city, but I wanted to study with the school master. Because of her, I agreed to study with the village teacher.

After completing ninth grade, the teacher informed us that he would move to the city, and if possible, we could study at his house. We thought we should continue learning from him since he started teaching us.

I began studying with him in the city, with my family’s consent. At that time, I was busy with reading and writing, as I was pursuing the science stream. I liked her since childhood, but I didn’t understand that liking and loving are two different things.

As time passed, I started growing up and began loving her, driven by emotions. I used to go to private places with her, but I never told her that I loved her. Fear held me back—what if I told her my feelings and she stopped coming with me?

Days went by like this. Many days passed, but I couldn’t express my feelings because I was afraid of seeing her reaction. I tried to express myself many times in different ways, but I understood that a girl's mind is not easily swayed. I used to recite beautiful poems to her, but she never seemed to grasp my true intentions. I tried to say the words many times, but I couldn’t.

Time passed, and we were about to part ways, no longer studying together. Every day, my heart pounded as I tried to muster the courage to tell her that I’d loved her since childhood. One day, I finally dared to place her hand on my heart and said, "See how I feel when you’re with me."

From then on, I gained more confidence. I would sit outside her window just to catch a glimpse of her and sometimes bring her a rose. I began to think that maybe she loved me too. Whether it was morning or afternoon, I would wait to see her, feeling at peace just by looking at her.

One day, I gathered all my courage and told her everything I’d kept in my heart. I expressed how much I loved her. She listened quietly and then said, “Whatever you say, my family will never accept this. And most importantly, I see you as a close friend. I don’t have any romantic feelings for you.”

I was shocked to hear this. I tried to explain myself many times, but she stood firm in her decision, saying it would be better not to continue. Since then, she hasn’t contacted me, and I haven’t disturbed her.

Love is beautiful when you find someone who reciprocates your feelings and becomes your life partner. Love can elevate someone, but it can also bring them down. Love is as beautiful as it is terrible.

    description: `
The word "dream" fills my mind with wonder, 

As one sleeps, yet the brain won't slumber. 

It’s astounding how we craft another realm, 

Where the subconscious plays and takes the helm. 
 
It feels like dreaming is one of the best human traits, 

When reality suffocates and the mind hesitates. 

Dreams come to the rescue, offering a sweet escape; 

It is called “daydreaming,” yet they say it’s a disease. 
 
But it is the other kind of dream that I love the most— 

This dream unveils a vision for life, a vibrant new coast. 

It drives one to strive for the best, 

Igniting hope and sparking one’s interest. 

That forms the urge to grow highest, 

Inspiring one to live even at their lowest. 
 
This is the kind of dream that sets goals in life, 

That creates dedication and lights the fire of desire in the mind. 

I love how dreams plant the seed of greed to succeed, 

How they make one push themselves harder without ever getting exhausted.

    description: `
Sitting by the school pool in late afternoon, 

The campus nearly empty, silence thick as gloom. 

Leaves danced softly in the warm summer breeze, 

While small waves in the water bring back memories. 

Laughter, games, and friends, like yesterday’s refrain— 

If only I'd known how soon those days would wane. 
 
10th grade finals done—how can it really be? 

It's time to leave, but it’s so hard to see it clearly.  

The time has come; we each take our separate ways, 

Friends off to new schools, on paths that won’t delay. 

Classes, labs, breaks—those memories stay 

Oh, how much I’ll miss each and every day! 
 
I walk through the halls, memories in each step I take, 

The classroom where laughter and life lessons awake. 

No more Kamal sir’s scolds or Masud sir’s advice on how to live a life, 

When Faysal sir let us watch movies in the lab—it was a sweet surprise. 

Every corner holds a piece of who I’ve become, 

These walls and rooms, where my heart feels most at home. 
 
Getting into this school was a battle, but it was worth the fight, 

This school lifted me up, my shelter, my light. 

When life felt heavy, it made me smile, kept me whole, 

These days are golden, engraved deep in my soul. 

Now I step forward, yet a part of me will stay, 

For in these walls, a piece of me will forever play.

    title: 'The Red Ribbon',
    description: `
In a college, Mawar, Vay, and Tikka were three friends. Among them, Mawar was the one whose birthday it was. So, Vay and Tikka wanted to give her a surprise. Every year, Mawar goes to visit her parents on her birthday. Like every year, after celebrating, she left for the cemetery as her parents were not alive. She took a bus to the cemetery where her parents were buried. Upon arrival, she first placed flowers on their graves and then sprinkled rose water on them. Then, she told her parents about two wishes. Her first wish was for the cake made by her mother, a taste she could never forget and had not found anywhere else. Her second wish was to find a man with a good heart. Since she was turning 20, she asked her parents for permission to have a boyfriend. After saying this, she cried about her loneliness to her parents. Suddenly, she realized it was evening, so she said "Ameen," saluted the graves, and left for home. Just then, she thought she heard footsteps behind her, as if someone else was coming out of the graveyard. She looked back to clear her mind and saw there was no one, so she returned home.

Her friends, Vay and Tikka, were worried but very happy to see her return. They also noticed she had a different fragrance with her and a box in her hand. Jokingly, they asked Mawar if she had found a new boyfriend. Smiling a little, she went to her room and opened the box to find a red ribbon. She put the red ribbon in her hair with a strange smile. Just then, the telephone started ringing. Tikka picked it up and heard a strange sound for a while, but no one was talking. After that, she put down the phone and looked back. Mawar was standing behind her, looking at her strangely. Vay thought it might be Mawar's boyfriend calling, so she left the phone without saying anything.

The next day was the first show of Tikka's radio station, where people could dedicate songs to their loved ones. Suddenly, the phone started ringing. She was very happy to get her first call, but on the call, she heard the same strange sound as the night before. After a while, someone started to talk, saying that he was Restu and wanted to dedicate the song "Promise" to his beloved. Tikka was very happy to hear this because she realized this was Mawar’s boyfriend. After dedicating the song and finishing her show, she went back home.

Later that day, Atika, the landlady who looked upon Tikka, Vay, and Mawar as her daughters, went outside to throw away the garbage. She saw something strange in the garbage bag but, after checking again, found nothing. When she returned, she noticed the house gate opening by itself, but no one was there. Atika got scared and rushed inside, only to find Mawar in the kitchen making tea by holding a hot kettle with her bare hands. Atika offered to help, but Mawar said she would make tea alone for her "new guest" who would arrive soon. Atika told her friends they should leave the house before 10 o'clock, as she would close the gate by then.

Later that night, Tikka and Vay went to ask Mawar about her new boyfriend, Restu. They suddenly noticed that Mawar's ear was bleeding. When they tried to check, Mawar behaved badly with them and told them to leave her room. She also said she couldn’t talk to anyone. Tikka and Vay got angry and left. The next morning, the landlady came to clean the house and discovered footprints, as if someone with rotting feet had walked all the way to the cup of tea on the table in the drawing room. She was very scared and shared everything with Tikka and Vay.

Then, Tikka and Vay went to see Leena, who was Alex’s best friend. Leena had practical powers, so they asked her to find out what happened to Mawar. They shared everything about Mawar's behavior since returning from her parents' gravesite, mentioning the red ribbon in the box. Leena told them to bring the ribbon to her. After a day, Tikka and Vay managed to get the ribbon and gave it to Leena. Leena explained that this red ribbon was connected to "Amavas," and while Mawar was at her parents' grave, it possessed her. Leena advised them to return the ribbon to the cemetery. With the help of Mawar's elder sister, Mitali, Tikka and Vay went to her parents' graves and left the red ribbon there.

A few days later, Mawar returned to her usual self and had fun with her friends again, though sometimes memories of Restu would flash in her eyes. One day, Vay found her dead. She saw Mawar with her dead body. Then, she woke up and found a note in her room. It was from Mawar, saying, "I know you all love me very much, but I cannot live without Restu. I can’t live without him." By reading this, they understood what Mawar was about to do. They ran toward Mawar's room and found the door locked from the inside. They broke into the room and saw Mawar hanging from the ceiling. The last words on her note were, "I would be happy if you all could feel Restu's love for me as I did."

He asked, "If the first love was true, then why did the second one happen? And if the second one is true, then why is the first one still in memory?"

She replied, "The first love was like a dream. What I lived was a thought that could never be fulfilled. The first love was a part of my life that was never complete, and that's why those memories still live in my heart. But the second love is real—it lives with me every day, every second. The moments I spend with you make me forget the first love."

He asked again, "So, you still remember him?"

She replied, "No, remembering him is just an unfulfilled thought, and living with you is a fulfilled dream. You are my life. You represent my happiness. The first love was a story, but what I have with you is true. What I feel every day is real."

He said, "So, do you truly love me?"

She said, "Yes. You are my life. The first love was a dream that left me behind. But you are the reason I live and the way to fulfill all my dreams. You are my present, and I see my future in you. Will you be my future forever?"

He said, "Yes."

Several days later, he left her for good. Once again, she lost the belief that she could speak freely with her partner, the one who is now her life partner, the sharer of everything, but not the sharer of her heartbreaks.

I am a driver by profession. My parents thought about my future and arranged my marriage. I was 23 years old then, and the girl was 17 and in the ninth grade at the time. Her family told me repeatedly that she was a good, talented girl and asked me not to let her stop studying.

My father-in-law held my hand and said, “Son, help my daughter with her studies.” I tutored her and worked extra hours to support her education. She studied well and achieved good results. In this way, seven years passed, and she completed her master’s degree. During that time, we had a son, who is now four years old. She finished her studies and got a good job.

One day, I returned home and found that both my son and wife were gone. After searching, I discovered that two lakh taka I had saved and my wedding jewelry were missing. Later, I received a call. From the other end, she said, “Forget me. I love someone else and will stay with him now. You’re just a driver, and we have nothing in common anymore.” I didn’t know what to say. I thought it was the worst moment of my life, one I could never understand.

After thinking for a long time, I called back and asked for my son, but she said he would stay with her and then ended the call. Some days later, I filed a case to gain custody of my son, but she agreed to let him stay with her. In the end, the court ruled that our son should remain with his mother, as he was too young to endure such difficulties.

Today, I feel empty. In the end, I am a broken man.

    description: `
When I read in class 8, I fell in love with a senior boy. On the day of 24 June 2021, I was lying on my bed and watching cartoons on my mother's mobile phone. Then, I heard a noise from our gate, and someone knocked on our gate. So, I went to the gate and saw our new tenant. Then, I opened our gate and saw him for the first time. The new tenant started to live on the other side of our flat. The boy was very attentive to his studies, and he always completed his 5 daily prayers. In a word, he was very polite.

As my mom and his mom became friendly, they started to come and go to each other's houses. One day, his mom invited me for dinner because my mom had gone to my maternal grandmother’s home. So, I went to their flat and saw him reading attentively. Then, I saw many storybooks on his table. I like to read storybooks. So, addressing him as bhaiya, I asked him if he would give me a book. He looked at me and gave me a book named Tin Goyenda. I felt very happy.

The next day, he came to my flat and asked me, "Can you give me a storybook?" I smiled and gave him a book named Rasha. One winter afternoon, his sister and I talked about our daily activities on our roof. We were the same age. Then, he came to the roof, and I started to blush. He noticed and asked me, "Why are your cheeks so red?" At that, I went down from the roof.

One day, I went to the roof to hang clothes, and he also came to the roof after taking a shower. He saw me and asked, "How are you, Madam?" I blushed again because he called me "Madam." I replied and went down from the roof as fast as I could. On the same day, he suggested a book named Ami Topu, written by Muhammad Zafar Iqbal. I read the whole book in one night and got very emotional at the ending.

I returned his book, and he looked at me and asked, "Why are your eyes so red? Did you cry all night?" I was astonished and silently glanced at him. He understood and said to me, "Crying is normal after reading this book. I also cried while reading it." Then, my mom called me, so I went to my flat.

After a few months, his SSC exam was about to start. He came to our flat and asked my parents to pray for him. Before going back to his flat, he said to me, "Please pray for me, Madam." I replied, "Fi Amanillah."

A few days later, while I was chatting with my friends, I saw his Facebook ID. I felt very happy and started to check his profile. After that, I began to observe his daily activities on Facebook. But I had no courage to send him a friend request. I checked his profile comments and reactions every day. He had many friends who were girls, which made me feel very angry and jealous.

A few months later, he, his sister, and I went to the roof together. Then, he asked us, "Have you ever liked anyone, guys?" His sister replied that she liked someone. But I didn’t reply. Then, his sister asked, "Did you like someone, brother?" Looking at the sky, he replied that he liked someone. Hearing this, my eyes were full of tears. So, I bowed my head and came down with difficulty. All night, I looked at his photo and cried for him.

After that day, I started to ignore him. A few months later, his SSC result was published, and he began preparing for Notre Dame College. Before the exam, he asked my mom about me and also came to our flat.

But seeing him, I went to the washroom and started to cry silently. A few days later, the NDC result was published, and he got the chance. Hearing this news, my eyes were full of tears. I didn’t understand anything and asked myself, "Are these tears of joy or of losing him?"

After a few weeks, my mom sent me to him for tutoring. Then, I sat down beside him and bowed my head. He smiled at me and said, "How are you, Madam? Here is your physics and chemistry book." I didn’t reply. He started to teach me very carefully. I was afraid to learn physics, but he always inspired me.

A few days later, he gave me a physics exam. But I didn’t get good marks, so my eyes filled with tears, and my cheeks became red. He noticed that and asked me, "Why are you crying? Are you a little girl?" Then, he told me, "It was your first exam in physics, so getting poor marks is very normal." He motivated me by saying, "Your marks are actually good, and you will get the highest marks in physics next time." But I wasn’t satisfied with my marks, so I left his flat as fast as I could.

One day, when I secretly looked at his Facebook photos, I accidentally liked one of them. I was very afraid. A few moments later, he came to our flat and asked, "Did you like my Facebook photo?" I replied, "No." Hearing this, he went back to his flat. Yet, I could not express my feelings for him. I became restless with anger and grief.

Then, the day of his departure came, and he left for Cumilla. I just stared at him through the window as he left. A few months later, they changed their flat and started to live in the building opposite ours. One day, when I came back from school, I suddenly saw him going to the mosque. I glanced at him, and my heartbeat was going so fast. But after a while, I got hold of myself.

Then, two years passed. My SSC exam had just ended. A few weeks later, I found out that he got admitted to RUET. I felt happy for him. Then, one day, my mother told me that he would come to tutor me from that day. I was surprised at that and told my mom that I wouldn’t study with him. But my mom didn’t listen to me.
At last, he came to our house to teach me. I was very nervous. I never looked at him. When he gave me math using the calculator, my hands shivered with nervousness. Seeing this, he asked, "Why are you so nervous?" I didn’t reply to anything.

A few months passed, yet I could not express my feelings. I still didn’t know if I could express my feelings to him. So, I didn’t look into his eyes anymore because whenever I looked into his eyes, I felt a lot of pain. I tried to express my feelings for him again and again, but I failed. A scornful sense worked in my mind.

But one day, when I was ready to express my feelings, he didn’t come that day to teach me. I was very upset that day. My eyes turned red with pain. I didn’t talk a single word that day. I got to know from my mom that he had suddenly gone to Rajshahi because his classes would start the next day and RUET had suddenly declared that.

I asked myself, "Why can’t I express my feelings to him? Why? Maybe in this life, I won’t be able to express my feelings to him anymore. It will be one-sided. But I really wanted to know if he ever had feelings for me."

    title: 'The Most Recent Thing I’ve Learned About Myself',
    description: `
There’s a saying that people can learn from the day they are born to the day they die. This world is filled with countless opportunities for learning, and we gain knowledge every day, every moment.

Recently, I learned something about myself: I’ve become more mature. Maturity is a concept we define in various ways, and the way I see it, I’ve discovered a sense of maturity within myself.

For example, a rickshaw puller might define maturity as the ability to drive a rickshaw. Similarly, from a child’s perspective, if you can solve their math problem, you’re mature. But to me, maturity is the ability to respond thoughtfully and spontaneously to questions or situations, especially when you’re mindful of your surroundings.

Imagine you’re speaking with a senior or a junior. If you can say exactly what needs to be said, based on the context, without overwhelming them or showing off, that’s maturity. It’s about understanding what is appropriate in a given situation.

Take another example: a doctor might be well-versed in medical terms, but if they were to discuss these terms with a businessman or an engineer, it would be unreasonable to expect them to understand everything. Trying to showcase one’s knowledge in such a setting would be unwise. True maturity lies in adapting to the audience and sharing knowledge in a way that fits the context.

I recently reflected on this and realized that I possess this quality. I’ve grown to understand my surroundings better and communicate accordingly, and I believe this is a valuable aspect of maturity that everyone should strive to develop.

I have discovered a wonderful thing in  my eyes since I got matured. This made me think about the greatness of the almighty. How beautiful he can make!!! . I discovered the greatness of the almighty by seeing a girl who is considered as one of the most beautiful inventions of the almighty in my eyesight. Her beauty is like a tan level of 90, infinite—meaning her allure never fades.

When she smiles, it feels as if thousands of flowers are blooming simultaneously, with the music of life playing in every petal. Her eyes resemble vast, deep oceans where I long to get lost, discovering something new with each wave.

Her presence is like a beam of light that touches the darkness and illuminates everything. When she speaks, it creates a melodious harmony in the silence of the universe that enchants my heart.

She is like a quantum particle, her beauty is changing with every moment but never diminishing 

If beauty were a number, she would be the greatest square root in algebra. Being with her feels like the neural signals between two cells, where each moment reveals a new discovery.                     
##I didn't specify who she is !!

    description: `
In a bustling seaside town, there lived a fisherman named Tomas. Tomas was strong, with hands calloused by years of casting nets into the sea and pulling in heavy catches. He was a quiet, steady man, and while his life was simple, he was devoted to his family, especially his young daughter, Lina.

Lina was Tomas's light—her laughter filled their modest home, and her curious questions kept him smiling, even after the hardest days. She loved the sea, just like her father, and would sit for hours by the docks watching him work, fascinated by the waves and the world beyond the shore.

One stormy night, Tomas set out on the sea. The winds had picked up suddenly, and though it was dangerous, he couldn't afford to return empty-handed. Lina’s mother had fallen ill, and the cost of medicine had drained their savings. Tomas needed a good catch.

But as the storm raged, the sea became wild, tossing his small boat like a leaf. Lightning split the sky, illuminating waves as tall as buildings. His heart pounded with fear, but he held tightly to the wheel, praying to the sea to show mercy. Hours passed as he fought to keep his boat from capsizing, pushing himself beyond exhaustion.

When he finally returned to shore at dawn, Tomas was battered and bruised, but his boat was full. As he docked, he saw a small figure running towards him in the dim light. It was Lina, her face streaked with tears, her hair wild from the wind. She had been waiting by the shore all night, worried he wouldn't come back.

Tomas knelt down and wrapped his arms around her, realizing how close he had come to losing everything that mattered. He promised Lina that he would never risk his life so recklessly again, that nothing was worth losing each other. They stood by the shore together, watching the sun rise over the calming waves.

From that day on, Tomas found a new way to provide for his family, teaching Lina the art of fishing, but only from the safety of the docks. Years later, as Lina grew and took over her father’s work, she carried the lessons of that night with her—a reminder of her father’s strength and of his love, which was as vast and boundless as the sea.

    description: `
In a quiet, fog-shrouded village nestled deep in a valley, there lived a young man named Aldric. By day, Aldric was a humble woodsman, a quiet soul who had spent his life on the outskirts of the town, cutting wood and providing for his elderly mother. He was known for his kindness and strong sense of duty, though he kept mostly to himself. But Aldric held a terrible secret, one he dared not share with anyone—not even his family.

One night, under the light of a full moon, Aldric had wandered into the woods to clear his mind. He had felt restless, haunted by strange dreams and an inexplicable hunger gnawing at his bones. As he entered the darkest part of the forest, a pain unlike anything he had ever felt surged through his body. His skin grew hot, his bones twisted, and his teeth elongated into sharp fangs. Before he understood what was happening, Aldric had transformed into a creature of legend—a towering, vicious werewolf.

He awoke the next morning, naked and shaken, his hands stained with blood. He had no memory of the night, but whispers in the village soon told him everything he needed to know: a pack of sheep had been slaughtered, and several villagers reported seeing a hulking beast with eyes that glowed like embers prowling through the shadows. Fear and suspicion gripped the town, and Aldric began to feel the creeping dread of what he had done.

Days turned to weeks, and Aldric did all he could to control the curse, locking himself away each full moon. He even considered leaving the village, but his mother’s frail health anchored him to the place he called home. Rumors spread, and the villagers grew fearful. Some took to leaving silver at their doorsteps, hoping it would ward off the beast. They spoke of a hunt to rid the valley of the creature, unaware that the monster they feared was one of their own.

In desperation, Aldric sought out a reclusive old woman rumored to be a healer with knowledge of ancient curses. She told him the transformation had been triggered by the bite of a wolf that had passed through the woods months ago—one that had been cursed long ago by a powerful spirit. “To break it,” she warned, “you must find the wolf that bit you and kill it under the light of a full moon.”

For months, Aldric hunted, tracking the beast through dark forests and moonlit glades. On the night of the harvest moon, Aldric finally confronted the cursed wolf, its fur matted and eyes blazing with a hunger he recognized in himself. After a fierce, terrible struggle, Aldric struck the wolf down, and as its blood mingled with the soil, he felt the curse lift.

    description: `
  Hello everyone, how are you all? Today I will write some stories from my real life. Whatever you call this story or incident, there are some good moments, some bad experiences and some bad times. My grandma died when I was in first grade. I heard grandma. Or he loved me more than everyone else and I understood a little at that timeAfter my grandmother's death, some of our things were separated between the three families, but we were still together.
  
  We used to hang out together, chat, attend occasion and cook a lot of fun together. Those were the best days I have ever spent. Those were the days. We still haven't forgotten. My younger uncle died when I was in class 7. Ever since he died, bad days came in our life. We were not at all prepared for these days. Day by day our relationship became bad. 
  
  What is money and wealth in people's life!! For these things brother does not know brother, sister does not know brother.From that time till today I study in 11th standard, till now we have no contact with my uncle.But we can solve it if we want, we can all be together again. But we don't want to solve it, because of our ego, our relationships remain like this forever.
  
  In fact, this is the reality, now people don't want to be together like before. But our mother -Fathers also don't understand the effect it will have on their children.If they see them, they will do the same when they grow up, they will not get the joy of being together, the education. Shouldn't our parents have taken care of us so that this influence does not fall on us?These things are common in our society now.
  
  That's why I don't consider this society as a healthy society. Can't we transform this sick society into a healthy society if we want? Yes, we can but we love this sick society more.I have faced many things at a very young age. Maybe it's bad for me but I learned a lot through it. I learned the difference between good and bad. Even today I miss those days so much that it's hard to explain. Finally, I want to say one thing, "This is how people's relationships are lost to money."
