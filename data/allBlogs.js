    title: 'A life full of promises cut short',
    description: `A video recorded just fifteen minutes before death shows him holding boxes of biscuits and water bottles, aiding the quota reform protesters. The viral clip captures protesting students running on a smoke-covered road with some taking water bottles from him. His act of kindness has touched the hearts of millions online. 

The young man is Mugdho, former Khulna University of student who was killed by a gunshot during the quota reform protest in Uttara on 18 July, shortly after the moment captured in the video. 

“When we heard that students were being attacked in Uttara, Mugdho, some friends and I rushed there to support them that day. Mugdho and I helped take away wounded people to the hospital,” said Naimur Rahman Ashiq, a friend of Mugdho.  “After distributing water and biscuits to the students around 6 pm, we were resting on the road divider when gunfire suddenly erupted from the direction of Rajuk commercial area. We started running with everyone else. Mugdho was shot and fell on the road. He was taken to crescent Hospital, where doctors declared him dead” 

Man, I still can't believe it. Mugdho, just a guy like us, full of dreams and future plans, is not here anymore. It’s just so unfair. He was trying to help people, and then this happens—he loses his life in such a horrible way.

I saw this video of him, like 15 minutes before everything went wrong. He’s holding boxes of biscuits and water bottles, handing them out to students protesting for quota reform. The video shows students running through all this smoke, and some are taking the bottles from him. It’s crazy how a simple, kind act became the last thing he did. When you watch that clip, knowing what came after, it hits you right in the heart.
Mugdho, he was from Khulna University, and he got shot during the protest in Uttara on the 18th of July. I’m still struggling to understand it. He was there, just helping people, and then suddenly, bam, everything changed.

His friend, Naimur Rahman Ashiq, shared what went down that day. They heard about students getting attacked in Uttara, so Mugdho, Ashiq, and some other friends rushed there to help. Mugdho wasn’t the type to just stand back and watch. He helped carry wounded people to the hospital, doing all he could. Around 6 p.m., after handing out water and biscuits, they were chilling on a road divider. Then, outta nowhere, gunshots start coming from Rajuk commercial area. They all ran, but Mugdho didn’t make it. He was shot and just fell. They took him to Crescent Hospital, but it was too late. The doctors said he was gone.

It’s so hard to wrap my head around this. In just a few moments, someone’s whole life changes, just like that. One minute, he’s helping out, doing the right thing, and the next, he’s gone. What really gets me is he wasn’t doing anything wrong. He wasn’t violent or anything. He was just there to help, and he paid for it with his life.

Stories like this make me think how crazy and unfair life can be sometimes. Mugdho’s story reached so many people online, and I think it’s because we can all see a little of ourselves in him. We all want to stand up for what’s right, make a difference. But we don’t expect something like this to happen. His death just shows how cruel the world can be, even to good, kind-hearted people.

Mugdho didn’t deserve this. But, even in his last moments, his kindness is something we should all remember.

    description: `The four-walled test hall,
There saw you I that day 
Soon as I saw you, 
Spring breeze in my mind stirred. 
Went there I looking for my mates
In chance I met you. 
Wish I asked your name!
Alas, time rolled again on its back, fast—
Exam was over! 
Never had I chance to catch a word,  
She sat in one-two-one, column two, row five, 
And I?—in one-one-eight, column three, row ten;
Had to haul me back to one-one-eight. 
But my mind never left that room—one-two-one! 
Only wondered if we’d ever meet—again?

    title: 'A Tale of Two Twins',
    category: 'Lifestyle',
    description: `I want to share this very important story with you. It is about two brothers, but it is about much more than that. In fact, it could be about sisters, or it could be about you, even if you do not have any siblings. 
It is also about an alcoholic father, but it is about much more than an alcoholic father. You see, this story I am about to tell is relevant to everyone. Yes, you as well.

There were two brothers—twin brothers. These brothers grew up with an alcoholic father. He wasn’t just an alcoholic father, he was bitter, drunk, abusive and aggressive, verbally and physically. 
The father was the worst kind someone could be for their children and those two identical brothers watched this unfold from the moment their eyes could see and their ears could hear. They watched their father all through their childhood, their teenage years and right until they moved out of the family home. 
Unfortunately, their father never changed. The drinking never stopped though the bitterness kept growing, the anger at the world, the blame of his problems to others never ceased. 
Fast forward, many years later, the little boys have now grown into two charming young men. Their father is now in prison, arrested for his violent crimes; unfortunately, it was not the first time. Along with him incarcerated is someone else, only younger; it is none other than one of the beautiful twins! 
The mother of the twins goes to visit her son in prison, and she asks her son, “How did you end up like this?” Angered at her question, he blurts, “What choice did I have? He was a mean, drunk…” he will not finish his words. He is furious at his father for the way his life turned out. After all, his father was the model whose influence drove him down this path.
On the way home, the mother visits the other son. This twin’s life has turned out be a bit different. He has never touched a drop of alcohol in his life; he is happily married with two beautiful children, living in bliss. The mother asks this son, “How did you end up like this?”
He responds, “My father was an angry alcoholic. What choice did I have? I didn’t want that life for myself. I remember thinking after watching him, ‘That would never be me. No matter what! I wanted the opposite, for me, and my kids!’”
Moral of the Story: 
It does not matter what happens to us. It only matters what meaning we give to what happens to us. That is what shapes our lives. That is what shapes who we will become. 
We can choose to blame other people and the world for where we are in life or who we become. Unlike the brother in prison, we can view negative things as blessings, a sort of caution for what we do not want in our lives. 
As a strong reminder, it must be considered that doing better is not going to be easy, but through work on us, accepting responsibility, we can create a better world for ourselves and our families, for the people we care deeply. 
We can live in anger or bitterness and point out the world is at fault. We will not have to search long to find such examples. Instead, we can see the good in others and the good in all situations. We can trust that even the hardest of challenges are sent for our benefit if we search. Thankfully, we will not have to search long to find it. 
We can be a victim or the victor in life. 
We can see a negative in everything or the blessing in everything. We can choose to take responsibility for our actions—not the circumstances, not the horrific things people do, only our actions and reactions. 
We cannot let circumstances or other people control our lives! The only one!

    description: `
    Once upon a time, there were two friends who were barely close, and they did not know much about each other. Their names were Ana and Deni. Ana thought they would be a good match and she felt relief because of finding a humble person. So, their days were becoming colorful by the company of each other. One day, when Ana was going to her aunt's house, she saw Deni on the street and asked her what happened. Deni told Ana that some people were talking behind her and added that she had fought with them for her. Though Ana felt bad hearing that news, she was also happy to have such a good friend. She told Deni goodbye and went to her destination. At night, when she was thinking about the day, Deni's words rushed to her mind, and out of curiosity, she asked another friend about the incident. One of her closest friends told her that she had not heard anything about the incident and also commented that what Ana had done was right. The thing is, a few days ago they had joined college, and she had created a group to stay connected with all the classmates. One day, a boy named Joe sent a request to join the group, and she approved it. One day, while scrolling through her social media, she saw a group where she had been added by Joe. He had added her without asking. At that time, she saw that a reckless boy had sent a reel that didn't suit the environment of the group. As the admin of the group, she told him not to send this type of thing in a group where he didn’t know most of the people. After some conversation, he said that he wouldn’t send those things anymore. But after some time, another boy sent a meme, and that was the start button. Then all the immature people started to send unsuitable messages. Seeing that, she left the group. After leaving the group, the admin of the group, Joe, messaged her and said sorry. After some days, they started to talk recklessly bad about Ana, which was informed to her by Deni. So, that was the short incident. After some days, another friend of hers sent her some screenshots of the group where they talked about Ana. After seeing the conversation, Ana felt fooled. Her friend, Deni, who informed her about this incident, was also involved in the reckless conversations, and Deni's words were negative for Ana's image. She asked her nothing about the happenings. Not because she couldn’t get hold of her, but because she felt a vast amount of hatred for this two-faced person, whom she had loved and believed, had deceived her. Though Deni continued to send her messages and tried to talk to her in person, Ana declined the proposal. Ana just ignored her. The End. ( Based on a true story).

    title: 'Whispers in the Dark',
    description: `
    I’m running recklessly, an eerie breeze howling through my ears, running too fast to control. Not knowing where I’m going, losing my balance and… I fell!
Gosh, this wakes me up. A nightmare once again. I pull out my phone to see the time—half past three. I get up to drink some water, shocked and horrified to see someone blurry sitting beside my bed with a small and timid light. Heck, it’s my roommate studying for our thanatology exam. Aghast and frustrated with myself for what I’m doing with my life, regrets flood in from the past. I finally manage to go back to sleep by dawn… but suddenly again I had a dream in my sleep, and the dream was so real that I could feel everything around me. It was strange and quite spooky as I could see one lady sleeping on a large bed. She was talking to herself and sketching something on a notepad. The woman was old, dull, and wearing torn, blood-splattered clothes.
From somewhere, a little girl came and started making noise. She started to cry so loudly that I couldn’t handle it, and then my (roommate)-friend woke me up and told me that the exam was in an hour. Half-awake, with my clock ticking faster than my brain processing her words, a panic attack paralyzes me. I know I can’t skip it.
I open my room door, and a bright ray of sunlight falls on my table, perhaps a glimmer of hope. Then we went outside, had our breakfast, and went to our research room. There was a cadaver (a dead human body). I was shocked—it was the same old lady from my dream. I started to get panic attacks and became unconscious.
When I woke up at midnight, I found myself in the bed of our medical room. At that time, I heard someone whispering from outside, "You are not alone." I began to follow that sound but found nothing. The sound didn’t stop, and I got irritated. In the meantime, my friend called me, asking, "Where are you going?"
I found myself on the rooftop—how I got there, I don’t know. After that night, everything was normal for several days...
Since that incident, it's been almost a month. We had just finished our yearly exams. Some of our team members decided to go on a trip. We were looking for a unique way to bond after our final exam. One of us suggested a weekend retreat to a mansion on the outskirts. We were intrigued. The mansion, a sprawling estate abandoned for decades, had been the subject of local legends about a tragic history involving a doctor who went mad.
So, all of us agreed to go there after 13 days. We left early in the morning from the college... it was almost dark when we arrived. Upon arrival, we found the mansion both grand and decrepit. It was in an isolated village, and a crumbling mansion stood abandoned, shrouded in dark legends. One stormy night, a curious historian ventured inside, and I felt an oppressive weight settle upon us.
The grand ballroom, though covered in dust, still had an air of its former elegance. As night fell, we gathered around a fireplace in the mansion, sharing ghost stories and medical anecdotes.

The real strange thing started when one of our team members, Lisa, found a hidden door behind a tattered curtain. It led to an old medical laboratory, complete with rusty instruments and glass jars containing strange, preserved specimens. Eager to investigate, we examined the lab and discovered old patient records detailing bizarre and unethical experiments.

As the night deepened, we began experiencing unsettling occurrences: whispers in the dark, flickering lights, and strange noises. One by one, we started to feel unwell, plagued by intense nightmares of being restrained and subjected to invasive procedures.
Then came the eerie discovery. In a corner of the lab, we found a large, dusty ledger with a crudely written entry: “To continue my work, I need new subjects.” The entries detailed experiments performed on patients, some of whom had mysteriously disappeared.
Panic set in as we realized that the mansion’s dark past might not be entirely over.
In the early hours of the morning, one of our team members, Mark, was found unconscious in the lab. He woke up with no memory of how he got there. We didn’t understand what was happening to us.
After taking our meal, we went out to view the area around the mansion. The local people lived quite far away from the mansion. We went there and had a talk with some locals, and we learned that there was a doctor who went mad and was brutally murdered. He killed so many people for his experiments and once he killed a pregnant woman with her 8-year-old child… it was his own family. After that incident, within one month, the doctor went mad, and the villagers found his dead body near a jungle by his mansion. Nobody knows how he got there… but they were sure that it was not a normal death.
From then on, sometimes the villagers hear some weird noises from that house. An old lady came to us with a picture of that family, and after seeing the picture, I was shocked—I had seen the little girl in my dream. How is THIS possible? It can't be a hallucination. It can't be any coincidence...
After hearing that, some of our team members suggested leaving immediately, but a few wanted to stay. I also wanted to stay and figure out what was happening...

    title: 'Definition of happiness ',
    description: `
   The definition of happiness varies from person to person and comes from our inner peace and contentment. For me, happiness is an abstract concept that can be found everywhere, depending on our mood. It’s not a treasure or a certificate that you have to earn by hook or by crook. Rather, it’s a state of mind. Happiness should be cherished. There are many people who possess material wealth, but they still seem dull or gloomy. The reason is often due to a lack of happiness. If you want to be happy, you must feel it. There is nothing about eyewash or pretending. When you're truly happy, it reflects in your eyes; they sparkle with the embrace of joy. 
I try to find happiness in the little things. For example, while I’m watering the garden, a butterfly might land on a flower. I pause, observe its beauty, and capture the moment in a photo, fully embracing its simple yet profound charm. That feeling is immeasurable. If you want to embrace real happiness you must understand the definition of it. I prefer small, simple things to make me happy. For instance, I might be drinking tea in a garden with a perfect novel in my hand, surrounded by the sounds of nature. I feel the beauty of the garden and take every sip of tea. These moments make my life beautiful, and no material possession, like an expensive car, could replace that. 
The happiness I feel during such moments is beyond measure. When I spend time with my parents, I see their beauty, loyalty, and care for me. That is the most priceless happiness I’ve ever experienced. In my life, I’ve chosen simple things to make me happy. If someone offers me tea at a quiet moment, I feel like I am over the moon. I find my peace and tranquility in these experience 
In conclusion, I want to say one thing: follow your heart and what it says. Don’t let others snatch your happiness. Wherever you are, remember to enjoy every moment of your life. Life is beautiful. As soon as possible find your happiness and live joyfully.

    title: 'A Precious Little Life ',
    description: `
  A sharp sting on my feet startled me awake from my sleep. The sting wasn’t painful enough to draw blood though. And without even opening my eyes, I knew the source of the pain.  As I cracked my eyes open, I sat up and picked up my cat who was busy playing with my legs. She looked at me with all excited round eyes, reflecting pure delight that I was finally awake. I pulled myself out of the blanket and carried my cat towards to kitchen to get her some food first. 
 I checked the time and it was already past 8 am. Which means both of my parents had had left for work by then. They didn’t call me before leaving. Because last night, I was up till midnight working on submitting an essay for a competition. The thought of starting the day without a glimpse of my parents instantly made my mind go dull and heavy. I couldn’t shake off the empty feeling forming in my heart. Letting out a long and steady sigh, I got fresh and tried to shove some food up my throat as I couldn’t bring myself to actually enjoy it at that moment. 
Before going to sit for study, I went to check on my birds at the balcony to make sure they had enough food and clear water. It had been a little more than seven years that I was keeping birds as my pet. The species of my bird is called ‘Budgerigars’ or ‘Budgies’ in short form. They are a little like parrot but very small in size and comes in many colors. They are very adorable and playful. I had brought up a number of pair of budgies in all those years but they had never increased in number. I had been waiting for that day to come since I was a kid, that one day while checking on my birds I’ll find a cute little baby bird in the nest. But that day never managed to come. No matter how much care I was taking of them, from making sure they were getting enough nutrition to keeping their nest warm and comfortable in the cage, none of my efforts worked out. Sometimes there were some infertile eggs in the nest, or no eggs at all. So eventually, I gave up on the hope of my birds having a baby and increase the number of their little family. 
I was so swept away in my thought, and my cat’s meow brought me back to reality. Well, it had really been pretty long since I last checked the nest. Even though I knew I’ll be disappointed all over again, I peered into the nest. I found the female bird sitting inside the nest.  She probably has laid some more infertile eggs, I thought. I was going to close the door of the cage when I noticed something like a green feather peeking under my white female bird. I leaned lower to get a closer look. Then the mother bird moved aside, REVEALING A GREEN LITTLE BABY!!! Oh My God! It was So much of an emotion to take in. My cat was looking at me confused because, feeling overwhelmed I had probably screamed out of joy. I was shaking with excitement as I called my mother to give her the news. She was also as happy as me and I instantly sent her some pictures and videos of the baby. 
When my parents came home, they made sure the baby was healthy and all of us were taking extra care of the birds. The baby was growing up really fast. The day the baby first came out of the nest, he was looking everywhere inside the cage with rounded eyes like it was the biggest house on earth. When all of its feather were done growing, it came out exactly like its father. And by the color of its nose, I knew that he was a boy. The little one month old baby bird was loved by so many hearts. My mom often let him out of the cage to explore. My cute little baby bird would explore the house while I locked my cat away. Even though my cat grew up with birds, no predator can ever be trusted near its prey. 
The baby bird also loved my cat. Whenever he saw the cat entering the balcony, he would stand at the edge of the cage and start chatting with her with his head tilted. But I never leave my cat alone with the birds. I always used to keep the door of the balcony closed and my entire family was instructed to do so. I needed to make sure that my birds were safe from any kind of threats. 
Days went by and my baby bird was growing up surrounded by love. He was then two months old. He wasn’t ready to fly yet. It was a typical Tuesday. I came back from college and found my mother home. But there was something unusual about the way she looked at me. There was hurt and pain all over her face and a sign of guilt. My heart jumped with anxiety thinking what might have happened. Mother brought the dead baby bird. There was blood all over his little head. The cat scratched his head with her nails when my precious little baby was standing by the edge of the cage, all excited to greet her.  
Everything hurt. It was the sort of pain that made it hard to breathe. The baby couldn’t even learn to fly! He was probably standing with disbelief when his forever best friend scratched his head. SO MUCH PAIN. That tiny little baby suffered so much pain that he never deserved. He was supposed to be the heart of our home flying around the rooms. His life wasn’t supposed to end like that. These thoughts made me cry harder. I was crying until I couldn’t see straight. I failed! A voice spoke inside my head. I failed to protect the bird. It wasn’t the cat’s fault. If only I was home that day? Or I warned them several times more about being careful about the balcony door? Could the baby still be alive then? I failed to protect the precious little life.

  Mother
You are the sparkle of the moon,
A decorative lamp in my life,
Burning among thousands of candles—
You are the picture that
Blooms among thousands of flowers.
You are the happiness clinging to thousands of storms,
With which my chest is filled.
Your love is not a love
That will ever leave.
If the word love is blessed,
I will say it only for you.
I am enchanted, I love you.
I love to stay in your shadow
All my life.
Your smile is the moon that has broken the dam,
Light after light.

Mother,
My mind is good remembering you.
Mother,
Don’t leave me.
Without you, I am a stranger—
No one cares like you.
When I see your magical face,
My heart calls for you,
And the hum of the sea surrenders.
That magical smile of yours
Will succumb to the vast waters of the sea.
Be in protest against injustice,
You are in struggle.
I am educated in your education;
You are the one who taught me how to read
And how to do math.
Little sands, little water—
I am in love with you; I am the abyss.
Birth loses to death,
Lies lose to truth.
Mother,
I lose to you.
If blessed is ever in action,
This is just for you.
I am imprisoned in the shadow
Of the green forest of your love.
I am the melody of your beautiful voice.
Do you know this story?
That magical face of yours
Fills all the happiness in the world.
You are the blooming flower beneath
The dark green leaves.
You come and catch all my mistakes.
Whenever I fall into a dilemma,
Your soft lips speak silently.
You are the rhythm in my poem.
I am proud to be born in your arms.
You are my dewy grass.
If I don’t see you for a moment,
My breath stops.
You rule me as a rebel;
Magical maternal love made more interested.
I will keep you as a queen in my heart.
Mother,
Will you give me some space at your feet?
Never let go of this hand of mine,
No matter how dangerous it may be.
Can I ever forget this endless debt of yours?
If ever this body of mine is buried,
Immortal be the title you gave me.

    title: 'Brain Drain in Bangladesh',
    description: `
  Brain drain is a big problem for developing countries like Bangladesh. It slows down the development of our country and takes away our peace and happiness. It is also destroying the future of the next generation, creating a very dangerous situation. If this continues, we won’t be able to maintain a proper democracy.
Brain drain happens when intelligent students don’t get the right opportunities for higher education in their own country. With no other choice, they are forced to go abroad for better education. Our education system is partly to blame because it doesn’t meet the needs of these talented students. When they go abroad, they find better opportunities, and their intelligence is appreciated. After that, they don’t think about coming back to Bangladesh, and this causes our country to fall behind.
On top of that, when countries are ruled by dictators, people lose their right to speak freely, making the situation worse. However, some brave students are still studying in Bangladesh. Last month, they gathered students from across the country to protest peacefully against the dictatorship of Hasina. Sadly, more than 1,000 students were killed during the protests because the police fired on them following her orders. Many of those students were bright minds who could have played a major role in creating a better country.
On August 5th, after 16 long years, Bangladesh gained its true independence with the fall of dictator Hasina, thanks to these brave students. Now, people can speak out without fear, and the intelligent students are running the country peacefully. People now understand that real progress can’t happen without the involvement of students.
To stop brain drain, we need to appreciate talented students in our own country. The education system should be changed to grade students fairly, and corruption in both education and the job market must be stopped. Jobs should be given based on qualifications, not bribes. If we don’t make these changes, another dictator might rise, and we could lose our freedom of speech again.
Therefore, it’s important for the government to encourage talented students to stay in Bangladesh and pursue higher education here. The government must offer them better opportunities, so they don’t feel the need to leave. If we can do that, we can stop brain drain and create a peaceful and developed country.

  I wanted to be sick all the time because I thought that way I wouldn’t have to do the house chores. That sick hobby of mine soon faded away. The reason was my dearest person’s passing. He was diagnosed with cancer. He was the strongest person I ever saw in my life. On 13.05.2016, he first told us about his chest pain. I don’t remember him walking me to school after that day. It was quite upsetting for me, but I grew out of it. Then suddenly, many of my relatives started coming to our house at random. My exam was approaching, but my mom was not there because she had taken him to India for better treatment. I was annoyed at how my scores started to fall, and for the first time, I failed in one subject. The reason was probably my mom not being with me, or my relatives and other guests I had never seen before making me lose my concentration. I don’t know why, but I started to feel really annoyed, and maybe my siblings did too. After 5 months, they came back with no improvement. I got frustrated. I started ignoring him. Was I too young, or was it my mentality? I don’t remember, and I don’t want to. The guilt still clenches me. My throat tightens whenever that memory flashes before my eyes. I remember my mom crying alone because she knew something that we didn’t. Another 4 months passed. Tomorrow is my final exam. I can’t sleep on the floor. My back hurts. Some people I don’t know are lying on my bed wide awake. They’re crying silently. I didn’t want to fail that exam, but I couldn’t sleep either. When my eyes finally closed, some faint voices started calling for me. It was my sibling. The voices started to become clear. I woke up lazily. They started crying loudly. I got annoyed and thought, why would they cry so much when I knew he wouldn’t die. I knew he was strong enough to fight back. I knew he wouldn’t leave us. He was lying on one side of the bed, and I was at the corner sitting. I looked at him closely after so long that my words got stuck in my mouth. His body was so skinny that it felt like his skin was disturbingly attached to his bones. I still had faith in him. Everyone was sobbing. But the voices became faint. A tear escaped my eye unknowingly. The guilt started gushing through me. I felt empty. I wanted to make sure that he didn’t leave us, but I couldn’t move and started observing everyone. I had hope in my eyes that maybe there would be someone who would assure me that everything was fine. It was a dream, but my dad’s reaction showed it all. Then it all just stopped. My hope, the clock, and his heartbeat. On 13.03.2017, at 3:20 am, my Dadabhai left us behind.

    title: 'About Being Creative',
    description: `
Creativeness can come naturally or forcefully. But there’s also one thing that not many people told you about. It’s stealing. Feels wrong but it’s the gospel. Every artist gets asked “where do you get your ideas from?” If the artist is honest he’ll reply with “I steal them” Now if you ask me how to steal then I’m going to say look around yourself and find what’s worth stealing, then you move on the next thing. If you don’t find something worth stealing today you might find it tomorrow or a month or even a year later. As the French writer André Gide put it “Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again” Now if you may ask what’s originality then the English writer William Ralph Inge’s going to say “Undetected plagiarism” If you feel like that you’re doing something wrong then mark the words of Mark Twain who said “It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected “ All you have to do is copy copy and copy until you find your true self. We’re talking about practice here, not plagiarism—plagiarism is trying to pass someone else’s work off as your own. Copying is about reverse engineering. It’s like a machine taking apart a car to see how it works. Remember even The Beatles started as a cover band. First you have to figure out who to copy. Second, you must figure out what to copy. Who to copy is easy. You copy your heroes. What to copy is a little bit trickier. Don’t just steal the style but steal the thinking behind the style. All you have to do is unlock your creativity.

    title: 'A time when I was challenged and how I faced it',
    description: `
One of the biggest challenges I ever faced in my life was moving to the city for my education, and it taught me to stay strong to confront my obstacles. I am basically from a village, not from the city. I always wanted to pursue higher education. That's why I enrolled in a college located in the city. As a girl from the village, it wasn't an easy task for me. I was commuting from my village to college, and it was a long journey. After traveling, I couldn't focus on my studies. Besides that, my parents, who are not highly educated, didn’t understand the situation, but they were trying their best to figure something out. However, I had a few relatives in the city, although we were not well acquainted. If I went there as a guest, they might have received me cordially, but if I went there to stay, it wouldn't be convenient for them. So, we didn’t think it was okay to bother them. At that time, I felt like I was the only one struggling, while all my classmates were already settled. Their tuition and accommodations were figured out. At this stage of life, I realized the importance of having some good connections in the city. Two months after I got admitted to college, I made a friend, and I talked to her about my situation. She told me that she had found a place to live and suggested that I join her. I gave it some thought and went to check the place out. Luckily, I liked it. Though the place was simple, at that time, I was too desperate for a place to stay. I remembered the proverb, "Something is better than nothing." I consulted with my father, and he agreed to send me here. Fortunately, this is the place where I am staying now. I am really grateful to her. That was a very challenging moment for me because I had to find a place all by myself. It was difficult, especially when everyone else around me seemed settled, while I was struggling. That was pathetic! In the end, I can say that challenges are an integral part of life. One more thing—there is no way to escape from them. The real heroes are the ones who overcome their challenges on their own. Honestly, now I feel like I am much tougher than before. I was once a girl who depended on her parents for every little thing, but now I face challenges daily. For instance, I am adjusting to a new place and new people. Consequently, those challenges have made me stronger and more capable. In conclusion, I want to say we all need to learn how to overcome challenges in our lives.

    description: `
We are familiar with various types of pollution and are working tirelessly day and night to combat them. We may mention types of pollution like air pollution, soil pollution, and water pollution, which can cause cancer, damage the skin, and much more. These hinder our longevity, right? But what if I say there is another form of pollution in our country—Bangladesh—that is far more dangerous? Yeah, you heard right. I am talking about lead pollution. The most dangerous part of the problem is that it affects our nervous system. It damages our brain and completely destroys our creativity. The effects of lead poisoning are gradual but certain. Historically, the Roman Empire is believed to have declined due to the extensive use of lead. Sadly, many people in our country are being affected by this problem. But they are not getting proper treatment because this issue is not widely known or properly introduced to most people. Isn't it something to think about? I am writing this to make people aware of the problem, as it is one of the most talked-about topics in other countries.

    title: 'The Power of Self-Employment',
    description: `
“The Entrepreneur builds an enterprise; The Technician builds a job.”
-Michael Gerber
In today’s world, there are many competitors in the job market. Among them, only a few people get the chance in this competition, and those who don’t succeed often end up in depression. This causes unemployment and has a dire impact on the country’s economy. So, I would prefer to build my career through self-employment. In this way, a person can be self-reliant. A person’s ability to self-actualize increases through self-fulfillment. Even doing any work can make you feel cheerful, and self-confidence also increases by implementing that work well. You will be able to create employment by developing something new through your own creativity. Not only will you benefit yourself, but you can also give many others the opportunity to work in your employment. In addition to this, you can also improve your financial status. By doing this, there will be a massive improvement in the country’s economy, and the nation will also prosper.
I believe there are no binding rules in this sector. You can work according to your own thoughts, with no fear of job loss. It is very necessary to learn about self-employment from our student life so that we don’t have to face any hassle regarding this in the future. But unfortunately, our institutions are not giving us the knowledge of self-employment. As a result, most students may not be aware of this topic. Students should know these mandatory things and develop their skills. In the age of the internet, you can easily develop your skills in any subject with the help of various websites and YouTube channels. By doing this, we can take the country to an extraordinary level. If we have the will, we can do many things and overcome all obstacles. But if we don’t have the desire to do it, then we can’t succeed, even if we have everything in our hands...

    title: 'A Story',
    description: `
I’m running recklessly, an eerie breeze howling through my ears, running too fast to control. Not knowing where I’m going, I lose my balance and… I fall!
Gosh, this wakes me up. A nightmare once again. I pull out my phone to see the time—half past three. I get up to drink some water, shocked and horrified to see someone blurry sitting beside my bed with a small, timid light. Heck, it’s my roommate studying for our thanatology exam. Aghast and frustrated with myself for what I’m doing with my life, regrets from the past flood in. I finally manage to go back to sleep by dawn, but suddenly, I have a dream that is so real I can feel everything around me. It’s strange and quite spooky; I see a woman sleeping on a large bed. She’s talking to herself and sketching something on a notepad. The woman is old, dull, and wearing torn, blood-splattered clothes.
From somewhere, a little girl appears and starts making so much noise, crying so loudly that I can’t handle it. My roommate-friend wakes me up and tells me the exam is in an hour. Half-awake, my clock ticking faster than my brain processes her words, panic attack paralyzes me. I know I can’t skip it.
I open my room door, and a bright ray of sunlight falls on my table, perhaps a glimmer of hope. We go outside, have breakfast, and head to our research room. There, I’m shocked to find a cadaver (a dead human body). It’s the same old lady from my dream. I start to panic and become unconscious.
When I wake up at midnight, I find myself in the medical room’s bed. I hear someone whispering from outside, “You are not alone.” I begin to follow the sound but find nothing. The sound doesn’t stop, and I get irritated. Meanwhile, my friend calls me, asking where I’m going. I find myself on the rooftop without knowing how I got there. After that night, everything was normal for several days.
Since that incident, it’s been almost a month. We had just finished our yearly exams. Some of our team members decided to go on a trip, looking for a unique way to bond after our final exams. One of us suggested a weekend retreat to a mansion on the outskirts, which intrigued us. The mansion, a sprawling estate abandoned for decades, had been the subject of local legends about a tragic history involving a doctor who went mad.
We all agreed to go there after 13 days. We left early in the morning from college. It was almost dark by the time we arrived. The mansion was both grand and decrepit, located in an isolated village. A crumbling mansion stood abandoned, shrouded in dark legends. One stormy night, a curious historian ventured inside, and I felt an oppressive weight settle upon us.
The grand ballroom, though covered in dust, still had an air of its former elegance. As night fell, we gathered around a fireplace in the mansion, sharing ghost stories and medical anecdotes.
The strange events began when one of our team members, Lisa, found a hidden door behind a tattered curtain. It led to an old medical laboratory, complete with rusty instruments and glass jars containing strange, preserved specimens. Eager to investigate, we examined the lab and discovered old patient records detailing bizarre and unethical experiments.
As the night deepened, we began experiencing unsettling occurrences: whispers in the dark, flickering lights, and strange noises. One by one, we started to feel unwell, plagued by intense nightmares of being restrained and subjected to invasive procedures.
Then came the eerie discovery. In a corner of the lab, we found a large, dusty ledger with a crudely written entry: “To continue my work, I need new subjects.” The entries detailed experiments performed on patients, some of whom had mysteriously disappeared. Panic set in as we realized that the mansion’s dark past might not be entirely over.
In the early hours of the morning, one of our team members, Mark, was found unconscious in the lab. He woke up with no memory of how he got there. We didn’t understand what was happening to us.
After taking a meal, we went outside to explore the mansion. The local people lived quite far away from the mansion. We went to talk with some locals and learned that the doctor who went mad was brutally murdered. He killed many people for his experiments, including his pregnant wife and 8-year-old child—his own family. After that incident, within a month, the doctor went mad, and the villagers found his dead body near a jungle by his mansion. Nobody knows how he ended up there, but they were sure it was not a normal death. Since then, villagers have occasionally heard strange noises from the house. An old lady showed us a picture of that family. I was shocked to see the little girl from my dream. How is this possible? It can’t be a hallucination or coincidence.
After hearing this, some of our team members wanted to leave immediately, while a few of us wanted to stay and uncover what was happening.
To be continued...

    description: `
Happiness is a relative term. The definition of happiness varies from person to person. From my point of view, happiness is something that makes you feel alive, something that gives you peace of mind. Happiness lies in the little things, the simplest gestures & the smallest moments of life. Different people feel happiness for different reasons. Hence, everyone has their own causes of Euphoria. Rather than confining happiness within words, I would rather depict happiness through some scenarios of my genuine happy moments.

Speaking about the night of 21st February 2024. It was certainly the best night of my life so far. I was over the moon. On that very night, I went to the rooftop & laid down there. The night was just perfect. There was a cool breeze. The moon was shining so bright. There were countless stars in the sky. I stared at the moon & the night sky full of stars to my heart's content while the cool breeze was hitting me. I felt goosebumps. I was humming my favourite songs while enjoying myself alone. Everything felt so peaceful that I  wanted to be stuck there forever. I have always been an ardent admirer of Luna(in Latin, the moon is called Luna). Every time I see her, my mood magically lightens up no matter what I'm going through. Maybe I'm someone beyond just a selenophile. I just can't write down all the emotions I felt at that moment. I felt alive again that night. I had an epiphany that life is worth it. That's what I consider happiness.

I'm the happiest whenever it rains. Hearing the sound of rain makes me feel at home. I'll forever be so in love with the rain. I'm an enthusiast of rain for Duas made during the rain are not rejected. I just whine like a baby to Allah (SWT) claiming my favourite things as soon as it rains. Sitting near the window or the balcony,  I enjoy watching the cloudy sky, the raindrops hitting the ground's surface & letting my hands get wet in the rain. It gives me peace, comfort & warmth. In the afternoon of 27 July 2024,it was raining cats & dogs. All I wanted was to get drenched in that rain. I went to the rooftop as wished. The moment the raindrops touched my skin I felt overwhelmed. There was heavy wind too. I haven’t been that happy in ages. In no time, my younger siblings joined me too. We had so much fun. We jumped in the water, slashing each other. I laughed so hard that day. I was beyond happy. I felt so at ease as if I belonged under the rain. This is my kind of happiness.

Since childhood, I always have wondered what it feels like to ride a boat. & I finally got to experience this the other day. There is a large field on the backside of our house & it was overflowing with the water from the recent flood. It was August 31, 2024, & we family members went on sailing together for the very first time. My father was the one who rowed the wooden boat. It was a sunny morning, but a gentle breeze was blowing to add to our comfort & enjoyment. The ripples of the water were making a sweet murmuring sound. The sunlight reflecting off the water created sparks, igniting the surface of the water. Birds were flying over our heads. We saw Kingfishers diving into the water to catch fish while my father was rowing the boat at fast speed, making it more thrilling. Let me share a secret, we again went on sailing later in the night at 10 PM. It felt so peaceful to ride a boat at night. The sky was sparkling with countless stars. We rode the boat at least 10 times. Once it was the time of sunset. We saw the sun floating towards the horizon. The crimson rays of the setting sun enhanced the beauty of nature. On 13th September, we went on sailing in the afternoon in rainy weather.  No sooner had we commenced on than the raindrops started falling. We were sailing away while drenching in the rain. It was a miraculous moment. It will remain a lifetime experience. If this is not Happiness, then what is?

Smeraldo flower represents - The truth I could not tell. As an INFJ I have always been bad at vocal. My mind is filled with eloquent words that can't be spoken out loud, only written. I'm always praised for being a good listener. But the listener needs a listener too, right? & who can be the best listener other than The As - Samee (The all hearing) , My beloved ALLAH (SWT)? I have several diaries where I write on different topics. Two of them are named  "The Truth Untold" & "Whispers of The Heart".  All my unspoken words, untold truths, heartbreaks, setbacks, wishes are written there. & I write most of them addressing Allah (swt). It gives me another level of happiness to write to Him. All my anxieties fade away once I write them down. Writing helps me clear my mind & makes me happy. My diary might not be one like Anne Frank's, but all my experiences, thoughts, dreams & feelings shape who I am and are a valuable record of my journey and a reminder of how far I've come.

Life doesn’t always go with the flow we want.
Life is full of ebbs & flows. There are days when we feel so low, we lose our most precious things, we face hardships. But I don’t lose hope in such situations . Allah (swt) says in The Quran : Your Lord has proclaimed, “Call upon Me, I will respond to you." (Quran 40:60)
My Lord has promised to respond to me. What can be more comforting than this?
I always make dua whenever I face hardships & I wait until Allah(swt) responds to me, until it turns zero o’clock. Here Zero o’clock is a metaphor of the time Allah(swt) responds. 
At times Allah(swt) responses to my dua instantaneously. I ask for a flower & He blesses me with a whole garden. Every door seems closed but He is the one who opens doors, doors I didn’t even know existed. He provides me from sources I could never imagine. He makes the impossible possible. 
& what could be more blissful than getting responses from your Rabb? I cry out of happiness whenever Allah(swt) responses to my duas. There are some feelings that are difficult to describe, the happiness I feel when He responds me is one of those undescribable feelings.

When I look back to the days I was a kid, I think about all of my childhood memories.
Amongst them, the ones of my nanubari are favourites. Sometimes I just wanna go back to those Golden Days. We cousins used to play around here and there. We used to roam around so many places. In winter, there was a special place where we all used to go and soak in all the beauty of the surrounding landscape. The place is mustard fields. But now so many things have changed. We hardly get together. Still, one thing is unchanged till now or you can say it’s increasing way deeper & that is the love I share with my grandparents. On December 2022, We were at nanubari to enjoy our winter vacation. My aunts, uncles & cousins were also there. It was the afternoon of 17th December 2022, we went out for refreshment & found a mustard field. I was awestruck & It felt so nostalgic. It reminded me of my childhood. I can reminisce everything. The memories I made there are the ones that I'll cherish for the rest of my life. Even thinking of these gives me an immense amount of happiness.

Eid has always been the most awaited and exciting event for me. As a kid, the most exciting part of Eid, for me, was going to NanuBari. It feels like only the other day I was a kid.Time, you old gypsy man! 
Every Eid at NanuBari, a familiar whine would escape my lips, a yearning for the bustling market. Nanavai really loved to take us cousins to a trip to the market. There was a special shop that stole my heart year after year. Its shelves overflowed with a kaleidoscope and vivid collections of Eid cards. Nanavai always knew how to make Eid at NanuBari even more special. He'd pick out the perfect Eid card for us. It was a small gesture, yet it felt like the most precious gift.
Each one, bursting with bright colors and festive designs, seemed made just for my smile.  They were little things, but they made those Eid vacations unforgettable.
Time, like the relentless tide, washed away traditions. One Eid, I went to the familiar shop but there were no Eid cards anymore. I still remember I had sulked the whole day. There was a competition of making Eid cards last Eid-ul-Fitr. Out of my love for eid cards, I worked so hard to make a beautiful Eid card. From gathering ideas to turning them into reality, I put so much effort. & eventually, the Eid Card turned out mesmerising in 2 days on 9th April 2024. I won that competition too. While making the Eid card, a smile tugged at the corners of my lips. It was truly made with love. In French, fait avec amour means made with love.

I love keeping photographs. I capture every moment that will be a beautiful memory to remember. I also pay more attention to the moments around me, natural moments like sunrises, sunsets, fog, rain and so on. When I scroll from image to image I feel so much. My lips curve into a genuine smile & I remember what had happened the moment I took that one selfie wearing my favourite sweater. I am taken back to my cherished memories when I see my photos with my bestie. I feel a rush of adrenaline when I come across some old photos. So I find happiness in capturing little moments. I sometimes film myself doing something. At times, I film myself describing my day, something that happened lately. I love documenting myself. Taking pictures of the little things or recording myself is a way for my life documentary. These are the archives of my teenage. These will be something to hold onto as I grow old. Maybe someday in my 
60s I will remember my young days, I can hear my teenage voice again, I can show my grandchildren my teenage era through these. Indeed, Forever is a word meant for memories, so are Pictures.

Having new books is another form of happiness. I always used to wait for the new year to come, for I'll get new books. In my school days, I was always excited to know what's there in the new books, what stories they contain. The smell of new books will always remain one of my most favourite smells. There is another kind of happiness in reading various kinds of books alongside textual books.They allow me to experience a whole new world.In books, I find solace, joy & a lifelong companion. They provide me with a perfect escape from reality. Some books are so close to my heart that I find myself revisiting them after a while, to feel those emotions again.

I had never stayed away from my family except a day when I was at my nanubari. Last year when I admitted to college, I had to leave my home. It was really difficult for me to stay away from my parents & home. I felt so vulnerable at that time. I cried my heart out. Everything felt so messed up. It made me realize the world doesn’t revolve the way I used to think. I realised how hard life is & yearned for going back home so much. However, after 5 days, I finally came home. Those 5 days felt like 5 years. The happiness I felt while coming back home cannot be described. I was even happier when I finally got to see my family members. I was craving for homemade food & Ammu cooked my favourite foods for me. I was so happy to sleep in my room again. I was so happy to go to the rooftop to see the moon again. Everything feels so serene here. Every single thing of my house is known to me, but when I come back home, every detail feels so new & thrilling as if I'm new here. I now realise how precious those little moments with my family are.

Serendipity means finding something pleasant without looking for it. Life is so unpredictable & full of surprises. Whenever I come home, my little cousins bring flowers for me. This little gesture is so endearing. The fact that I love flowers & them bringing flowers, especially for me, makes me feel so special & loved. There are many people around me who genuinely adore me. They occasionally give me presents. They are always there in my hard times & try their best to help me. And it makes me happy knowing that they care for me, they care enough to spend a part of their time for me. Being treated well without asking for it means a lot. These gestures are what happiness is about.

Winter & Spring are seasons that hold a special place in my heart. I always wait for these seasons to come. I just love the vibe of these seasons. I like those wintry afternoons when it’s getting dark outside early & I'm sitting inside wearing my favourite cardigan or hoodie. It feels so peaceful and cozy to snuggle under the blanket in wintery nights & sleep like a winter bear. I love those foggy mornings. Winter brings me joy & comfort and I always feel a sense of warmth and happiness during this time of the year. I would love to wait until the spring day comes again, until the flower blooms again. In spring, the nature comes alive again with color, sound and energy. From the birds chirping, new leaves growing to the wildflowers blooming, I love everything about spring. These are my happy moments of life. Indeed, the most beautiful moment of life is yet to come.

Happiness is subjective. It's the simple joys like spending time with kids or cats, enjoying a beautiful sunset or wearing your favourite dress. Painting makes me happy. Cooking & eating noodles bring me joy. I get excited when I get updates on my online purchase. I love to go out for shopping. I'm super happy when I find the perfect shade of lipstick I was looking for. My bucket fills when I bring a smile to a stranger's face by helping. I feel euphoric to buy new dresses, shoes, sweaters or accessories. A pretty sky makes me smile. Watching birds fly makes me happy. Happiness is achieved by having positive thinking & noticing the little things of life. Be grateful to The Creator for all the blessings & your life will be spontaneously happy.

Without this sessional types of therapies,there's have a lot of therapeutical things in our daily life.If I describe my daily therapeutical things it should look like the text below--
Having a beautiful coffee corner is like a therapy for coffee lover.Whenever they feel low,they can stay there and can have peace.
When my favourite person gives me flowers,I feel pacific for a moment.
When I don’t find no one to talk to,I write diaries.By this,I talk with myself it makes me feel lighter.
I have my favourite water bottle,anytime I look at my favourite water bottle, I do smile for a moment.
Once my mom gave me a homeplant for my room.whensoever I see it,I feel bold and can more exact to my goal.
I'm not a great artist but I love painting.It feels me chaotic for a while.
In this age,I normally faced a lot of problems in my school and college.When I talk about my teenage problems with my dad,he takes out me for a lunch together.It means a lot to me.I can have the energy from my dad to tackle my problems.
My mom once bought a perfume for me.Whenever I smell that perfume,it's make me feel calm and fresh.
I have some pictures and videos of my childhood and school life.This beautiful memories reminds me to bold up.
In my school life,I was introduced to some peaceful place.Whenever I felt bored,I usually go those places and feel the freshness of nature.Going to those places makes me feel like exposing my inner person to myself.
These all makes me happy and works as therapy to me.Like these things,we all have a lots of therapy types in our daily life.Sometimes we can feel the emotion and heal the moment.On the other hand,sometimes we couldn’t.

I felt the emotion of therapy to also a several person in this little age.My first therapist I feel is my best friend.I met her few years ago and she helps me to find out the best option for me in every situation.She can make me happy in a moment.I gave her that priority by thinking her my therapist cause I felt she had that ability.I feel her like a sister from another mother.
Furthermore,I love my mom as a therapist.She has an magical noor in her voice and face.She can make me feel the bestest in the world.Everytime I look at her face and hears her voice make me feel like the best peacest moment in my life.I can't even express that feeling properly.
In addition,there's have another person spotted recently in my life.I address him as my brother and he also address me as his sister.If unfortunately I can't have my best friend or my mom in any situation,he can be the best option for me to make my best decisions.It's feels like god blessed me with this persons in my life.
Basically,we feel the therapy to a person.We think,only man can be a therapist.But not only man's but also the every tiny things can be our therapeutical partner.
In the end of my writing,I want to say that I also want to be a therapist in everyone's life.Being a therapist is the most prioritized character in someone's life.So,if someone address me as a personal therapist,I'll be grateful to god.
