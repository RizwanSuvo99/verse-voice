    title: 'A life full of promises cut short',
    description: `A video recorded just fifteen minutes before death shows him holding boxes of biscuits and water bottles, aiding the quota reform protesters. The viral clip captures protesting students running on a smoke-covered road with some taking water bottles from him. His act of kindness has touched the hearts of millions online. 

The young man is Mugdho, former Khulna University of student who was killed by a gunshot during the quota reform protest in Uttara on 18 July, shortly after the moment captured in the video. 

“When we heard that students were being attacked in Uttara, Mugdho, some friends and I rushed there to support them that day. Mugdho and I helped take away wounded people to the hospital,” said Naimur Rahman Ashiq, a friend of Mugdho.  “After distributing water and biscuits to the students around 6 pm, we were resting on the road divider when gunfire suddenly erupted from the direction of Rajuk commercial area. We started running with everyone else. Mugdho was shot and fell on the road. He was taken to crescent Hospital, where doctors declared him dead” 

Man, I still can't believe it. Mugdho, just a guy like us, full of dreams and future plans, is not here anymore. It’s just so unfair. He was trying to help people, and then this happens—he loses his life in such a horrible way.

I saw this video of him, like 15 minutes before everything went wrong. He’s holding boxes of biscuits and water bottles, handing them out to students protesting for quota reform. The video shows students running through all this smoke, and some are taking the bottles from him. It’s crazy how a simple, kind act became the last thing he did. When you watch that clip, knowing what came after, it hits you right in the heart.
Mugdho, he was from Khulna University, and he got shot during the protest in Uttara on the 18th of July. I’m still struggling to understand it. He was there, just helping people, and then suddenly, bam, everything changed.

His friend, Naimur Rahman Ashiq, shared what went down that day. They heard about students getting attacked in Uttara, so Mugdho, Ashiq, and some other friends rushed there to help. Mugdho wasn’t the type to just stand back and watch. He helped carry wounded people to the hospital, doing all he could. Around 6 p.m., after handing out water and biscuits, they were chilling on a road divider. Then, outta nowhere, gunshots start coming from Rajuk commercial area. They all ran, but Mugdho didn’t make it. He was shot and just fell. They took him to Crescent Hospital, but it was too late. The doctors said he was gone.

It’s so hard to wrap my head around this. In just a few moments, someone’s whole life changes, just like that. One minute, he’s helping out, doing the right thing, and the next, he’s gone. What really gets me is he wasn’t doing anything wrong. He wasn’t violent or anything. He was just there to help, and he paid for it with his life.

Stories like this make me think how crazy and unfair life can be sometimes. Mugdho’s story reached so many people online, and I think it’s because we can all see a little of ourselves in him. We all want to stand up for what’s right, make a difference. But we don’t expect something like this to happen. His death just shows how cruel the world can be, even to good, kind-hearted people.

Mugdho didn’t deserve this. But, even in his last moments, his kindness is something we should all remember.

    description: `The four-walled test hall,
There saw you I that day 
Soon as I saw you, 
Spring breeze in my mind stirred. 
Went there I looking for my mates
In chance I met you. 
Wish I asked your name!
Alas, time rolled again on its back, fast—
Exam was over! 
Never had I chance to catch a word,  
She sat in one-two-one, column two, row five, 
And I?—in one-one-eight, column three, row ten;
Had to haul me back to one-one-eight. 
But my mind never left that room—one-two-one! 
Only wondered if we’d ever meet—again?

    title: 'A Tale of Two Twins',
    category: 'Poetry',
    description: `I want to share this very important story with you. It is about two brothers, but it is about much more than that. In fact, it could be about sisters, or it could be about you, even if you do not have any siblings. 
It is also about an alcoholic father, but it is about much more than an alcoholic father. You see, this story I am about to tell is relevant to everyone. Yes, you as well.

There were two brothers—twin brothers. These brothers grew up with an alcoholic father. He wasn’t just an alcoholic father, he was bitter, drunk, abusive and aggressive, verbally and physically. 
The father was the worst kind someone could be for their children and those two identical brothers watched this unfold from the moment their eyes could see and their ears could hear. They watched their father all through their childhood, their teenage years and right until they moved out of the family home. 
Unfortunately, their father never changed. The drinking never stopped though the bitterness kept growing, the anger at the world, the blame of his problems to others never ceased. 
Fast forward, many years later, the little boys have now grown into two charming young men. Their father is now in prison, arrested for his violent crimes; unfortunately, it was not the first time. Along with him incarcerated is someone else, only younger; it is none other than one of the beautiful twins! 
The mother of the twins goes to visit her son in prison, and she asks her son, “How did you end up like this?” Angered at her question, he blurts, “What choice did I have? He was a mean, drunk…” he will not finish his words. He is furious at his father for the way his life turned out. After all, his father was the model whose influence drove him down this path.
On the way home, the mother visits the other son. This twin’s life has turned out be a bit different. He has never touched a drop of alcohol in his life; he is happily married with two beautiful children, living in bliss. The mother asks this son, “How did you end up like this?”
He responds, “My father was an angry alcoholic. What choice did I have? I didn’t want that life for myself. I remember thinking after watching him, ‘That would never be me. No matter what! I wanted the opposite, for me, and my kids!’”
Moral of the Story: 
It does not matter what happens to us. It only matters what meaning we give to what happens to us. That is what shapes our lives. That is what shapes who we will become. 
We can choose to blame other people and the world for where we are in life or who we become. Unlike the brother in prison, we can view negative things as blessings, a sort of caution for what we do not want in our lives. 
As a strong reminder, it must be considered that doing better is not going to be easy, but through work on us, accepting responsibility, we can create a better world for ourselves and our families, for the people we care deeply. 
We can live in anger or bitterness and point out the world is at fault. We will not have to search long to find such examples. Instead, we can see the good in others and the good in all situations. We can trust that even the hardest of challenges are sent for our benefit if we search. Thankfully, we will not have to search long to find it. 
We can be a victim or the victor in life. 
We can see a negative in everything or the blessing in everything. We can choose to take responsibility for our actions—not the circumstances, not the horrific things people do, only our actions and reactions. 
We cannot let circumstances or other people control our lives! The only one!
